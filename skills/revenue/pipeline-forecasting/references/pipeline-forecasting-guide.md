# Pipeline Management & Revenue Forecasting

## Overview
Build accurate revenue forecasts and manage your sales pipeline systematically. This skill helps solo entrepreneurs and small teams predict revenue, identify gaps, and make data-driven decisions about growth.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Forecasting monthly/quarterly revenue
- Tracking deal progress
- Identifying pipeline gaps
- Improving forecast accuracy
- Understanding sales velocity
- Planning cash flow
- Making hiring/spending decisions

---

## Why Forecasting Matters

**The Business Impact:**
```
Without forecasting:
• Surprised by revenue shortfalls
• Can't plan hiring or spending
• Miss opportunities to fix pipeline gaps
• Make reactive decisions

With forecasting:
• Predict revenue 3-6 months ahead
• Plan investments confidently
• Identify problems early
• Make proactive decisions

Benefit: 30% better resource allocation, avoid $50K+ cash flow issues
```

**Forecast Accuracy = Better Decisions:**
```
Scenario: Planning to hire sales rep ($100K/year)

Bad forecast: "We'll probably hit $500K ARR"
Risk: Hire too early → burn cash → miss runway

Good forecast: "85% confidence we'll hit $480-520K ARR in Q3"
Decision: Hire in Q3 when revenue supports it

Accurate forecasting prevents expensive mistakes
```

---

## Pipeline Fundamentals

### What is a Pipeline?

```
Pipeline = All potential revenue in various stages of the sales process

Example B2B SaaS Pipeline:
Lead (100 leads)
  ↓ 20% qualify
MQL (20 marketing qualified leads)
  ↓ 50% accept
SQL (10 sales qualified leads)
  ↓ 60% demo
Opportunity (6 opportunities, $60K total value)
  ↓ 33% close
Closed-Won (2 deals, $20K closed revenue)

Pipeline value: $60K
Expected revenue: $20K (33% win rate × $60K)
```

---

### Pipeline Stages

**Standard B2B SaaS Stages:**
```
1. Lead (Unqualified)
2. MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)
3. SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)
4. Opportunity/Discovery
5. Demo/Presentation
6. Proposal Sent
7. Negotiation
8. Closed-Won
9. Closed-Lost

Each stage has:
• Entry criteria (what qualifies for this stage?)
• Exit criteria (what moves to next stage?)
• Expected conversion rate
• Average time in stage
```

**Example Stage Definitions:**

**Opportunity Stage:**
```
Entry Criteria:
• Budget confirmed ($10K+)
• Decision maker identified
• Timeline defined (< 6 months)
• Clear pain point articulated

Exit Criteria:
• Demo completed
• Technical requirements gathered
• Move to Proposal stage

Metrics:
• Conversion to Demo: 60%
• Average time in stage: 7 days
```

---

## Building Your First Forecast

### Step 1: Define Your Sales Cycle

**Calculate Average Sales Cycle Length:**
```
Formula: Average days from Opportunity created to Closed-Won

Example:
Deal 1: 45 days
Deal 2: 60 days
Deal 3: 30 days
Deal 4: 90 days
Deal 5: 50 days

Average: (45+60+30+90+50) / 5 = 55 days

Your sales cycle: ~2 months
```

**Why this matters:**
- Tells you how far ahead to forecast
- Helps identify slow-moving deals
- Benchmarks deal velocity

---

### Step 2: Calculate Win Rate

**Formula:**
```
Win Rate = Closed-Won deals / (Closed-Won + Closed-Lost)

Example Last Quarter:
Closed-Won: 12 deals
Closed-Lost: 28 deals
Total: 40 deals

Win Rate = 12 / 40 = 30%

Benchmark: 20-30% (B2B SaaS)
```

**Win Rate by Stage:**
```
Opportunity → Demo: 60%
Demo → Proposal: 70%
Proposal → Negotiation: 50%
Negotiation → Closed-Won: 60%

Overall Win Rate = 0.60 × 0.70 × 0.50 × 0.60 = 12.6%
```

---

### Step 3: Build a Simple Forecast

**Formula:**
```
Forecast = Pipeline Value × Win Rate × Time Factor

Example:
Pipeline value: $100K (10 opportunities @ $10K each)
Win rate: 30%
Time factor: 50% (half will close this quarter)

Forecast = $100K × 30% × 50% = $15K this quarter
```

**Monthly Forecast Template:**
```
Month: March 2024

Stage: Negotiation ($50K pipeline, 60% win rate)
Expected: $30K

Stage: Proposal ($80K pipeline, 35% win rate)
Expected: $28K

Stage: Demo ($100K pipeline, 21% win rate)
Expected: $21K

Stage: Opportunity ($150K pipeline, 12% win rate)
Expected: $18K

Total Forecast: $97K

Reality check: Is this realistic given historical close rates?
```

---

## Forecast Categories

### Commit vs. Best Case vs. Pipeline

**Commit (High Confidence):**
```
Definition: 90%+ likely to close
Criteria:
• Contract sent/signed
• Budget approved
• Decision maker committed
• Close date this month

Example: $50K in Negotiation stage, verbal commit
```

**Best Case (Medium Confidence):**
```
Definition: 50-70% likely to close
Criteria:
• Proposal sent
• Strong interest
• Budget confirmed
• Close date within quarter

Example: $80K in Proposal stage, positive signals
```

**Pipeline (Low Confidence):**
```
Definition: 20-40% likely to close
Criteria:
• Early stage (Opportunity, Demo)
• No proposal yet
• Timeline uncertain

Example: $150K in Discovery/Demo stages
```

**Forecast Report:**
```
Q1 2024 Forecast

Commit: $50K (90% confidence)
Best Case: $130K (Commit + $80K)
Pipeline: $280K (Best Case + $150K)

Conservative forecast: $50K
Realistic forecast: $90-120K
Stretch goal: $200K+
```

---

## Pipeline Metrics

### 1. Pipeline Coverage Ratio

**Formula:**
```
Coverage = Total Pipeline Value / Quarterly Revenue Target

Example:
Pipeline: $300K
Quarterly target: $100K

Coverage = $300K / $100K = 3x

Benchmark: 3-5x coverage needed
```

**Why it matters:**
```
3x coverage = Comfortable (assuming 33% win rate)
2x coverage = Risky (need high win rate or fast velocity)
5x+ coverage = Healthy (can afford to lose deals)

If coverage < 3x: URGENT pipeline generation needed
```

---

### 2. Pipeline Velocity

**Formula:**
```
Velocity = (# Opportunities × Avg Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length

Example:
Opportunities: 10 per month
Avg deal: $10K
Win rate: 30%
Sales cycle: 60 days (2 months)

Velocity = (10 × $10K × 0.30) / 2 = $15K per month
Annual run rate = $15K × 12 = $180K
```

**How to improve velocity:**
- Increase # opportunities (marketing, outbound)
- Increase avg deal size (upsell, better targeting)
- Increase win rate (better qualification, sales skills)
- Decrease sales cycle (remove friction, faster follow-up)

---

### 3. Stage Conversion Rates

**Track conversion at each stage:**
```
Lead → MQL: 20% (industry: 13-20%)
MQL → SQL: 50% (industry: 30-50%)
SQL → Opportunity: 60% (industry: 50-60%)
Opportunity → Closed-Won: 30% (industry: 20-30%)

Identify bottlenecks:
• Low Lead → MQL? Marketing targeting issue
• Low MQL → SQL? Lead quality issue
• Low SQL → Opp? Qualification issue
• Low Opp → Won? Sales execution issue
```

---

### 4. Deal Age / Time in Stage

**Identify stale deals:**
```
Average time in Opportunity stage: 15 days

Deals over 30 days:
• Deal A: 45 days (stuck - need action)
• Deal B: 38 days (stuck - need action)
• Deal C: 32 days (getting stale)

Action: Review stale deals weekly, close or drop
```

**Why stale deals are dangerous:**
- Lower win probability
- Distract from fresh opportunities
- Inflate pipeline artificially
- Hurt forecast accuracy

---

## Forecasting Methodologies

### Method 1: Stage-Based Forecasting (Simplest)

**Assign probability to each stage:**
```
Opportunity: 10% likely to close
Demo: 20%
Proposal: 40%
Negotiation: 70%
Verbal Commit: 90%

Weighted Pipeline:
10 Opportunities @ $10K × 10% = $10K
5 Demos @ $12K × 20% = $12K
3 Proposals @ $15K × 40% = $18K
2 Negotiations @ $20K × 70% = $28K

Forecast: $68K
```

**Pros:** Simple, easy to understand
**Cons:** Assumes all deals in stage are equal (not true)

---

### Method 2: Historical Win Rate (More Accurate)

**Use actual historical data:**
```
Last 12 months:
Opportunities: 100 entered, 30 closed
Win rate: 30%

Current pipeline: 20 opportunities @ $10K = $200K
Forecast: $200K × 30% = $60K

Adjust for time:
Sales cycle: 60 days
Forecast period: 90 days (Q1)
Time factor: 100% (deals will close within period)

Final forecast: $60K
```

**Pros:** Based on actual performance
**Cons:** Assumes future = past (not always true)

---

### Method 3: Deal-by-Deal Forecasting (Most Accurate)

**Evaluate each deal individually:**
```
Deal A: $50K, Negotiation
• Champion: Yes
• Budget: Confirmed
• Decision date: This month
• Competition: None
→ Probability: 80% → $40K

Deal B: $30K, Proposal
• Champion: Weak
• Budget: Not confirmed
• Decision date: Next quarter
• Competition: Two others
→ Probability: 30% → $9K

Deal C: $20K, Demo
• Champion: Yes
• Budget: Confirmed
• Decision date: This month
• Competition: One other
→ Probability: 50% → $10K

Forecast: $40K + $9K + $10K = $59K
```

**Pros:** Most accurate for small pipelines
**Cons:** Time-consuming, subjective

---

## Pipeline Management Best Practices

### 1. Weekly Pipeline Reviews

**What to review:**
```
Monday Morning Routine (30 min):

1. Review last week's closed deals
   • Why did we win?
   • Why did we lose?

2. Identify deals closing this week
   • What's needed to close?
   • Any blockers?

3. Check stale deals (>30 days in stage)
   • Move forward or disqualify

4. Calculate pipeline coverage
   • Do we have enough pipeline for target?

5. Update forecast
   • Adjust probabilities based on new info
```

---

### 2. Move Deals Forward or Disqualify

**Stuck Deal Decision Tree:**
```
Is deal >30 days in current stage?
  ↓ YES
Have we contacted prospect in last 7 days?
  ↓ NO
Is prospect responding to outreach?
  ↓ NO
→ DISQUALIFY (mark Closed-Lost)

Why disqualify?
• Clears false pipeline
• Focuses on real opportunities
• Improves forecast accuracy
```

**Disqualification Reasons:**
```
• No budget (QUALIFIED OUT)
• No timeline (QUALIFIED OUT)
• No response (DEAD LEAD)
• Chose competitor (LOST)
• Not a fit (QUALIFIED OUT)
```

---

### 3. Pipeline Generation Discipline

**Rule: Always be filling the top of funnel**

**Monthly targets:**
```
Goal: $50K in new monthly revenue
Win rate: 25%
Needed pipeline: $50K / 0.25 = $200K

If avg deal = $10K:
Need 20 new qualified opportunities per month

Breakdown:
• Week 1: 5 new opps
• Week 2: 5 new opps
• Week 3: 5 new opps
• Week 4: 5 new opps

Sources:
• Inbound (marketing): 2/week
• Outbound (SDR/sales): 3/week
```

---

### Reports to Build

**Report 1: Pipeline by Stage**
```
Stage            | # Deals | Total Value | Weighted Value
-----------------|---------|-------------|---------------
Opportunity      | 10      | $100K       | $10K (10%)
Demo             | 6       | $72K        | $14.4K (20%)
Proposal         | 4       | $60K        | $24K (40%)
Negotiation      | 2       | $40K        | $28K (70%)
-----------------|---------|-------------|---------------
TOTAL            | 22      | $272K       | $76.4K
```

**Report 2: Pipeline by Close Date**
```
Close Month | # Deals | Pipeline Value | Forecast
------------|---------|----------------|----------
March       | 8       | $120K          | $45K
April       | 10      | $100K          | $35K
May         | 4       | $52K           | $18K
------------|---------|----------------|----------
Q1 Total    | 22      | $272K          | $98K
```

**Report 3: Win/Loss Analysis**
```
Last Quarter:
Closed-Won: 12 deals ($150K)
Closed-Lost: 28 deals
Win Rate: 30%

Top Loss Reasons:
• Price (35%)
• No budget (25%)
• Chose competitor (20%)
• Timing (15%)
• Other (5%)

Action: Address top 2 loss reasons
```

## Forecast Accuracy Improvement

### Track Accuracy Over Time

**Monthly Review:**
```
January Forecast: $50K
January Actual: $45K
Accuracy: 90% (within 10%)

February Forecast: $60K
February Actual: $35K
Accuracy: 58% (off by 42% - investigate!)

March Forecast: $55K
March Actual: $52K
Accuracy: 95%

Trend: Improving (95% is excellent)
```

**Why forecasts miss:**
- Deals slip (close date pushed)
- Overestimated probabilities
- Didn't account for seasonality
- Pipeline not updated regularly

---

### Calibrate Your Probabilities

**Test your probability estimates:**
```
For deals you marked "70% likely":
• How many actually closed?
• If 7 out of 10 closed → calibrated ✓
• If 4 out of 10 closed → too optimistic ✗

Adjust:
If your "70%" deals close 40% of time:
→ Use 40% probability instead
```

---

## Forecasting for Different Business Models

### B2B SaaS (Subscription)

**Forecast Components:**
```
Total MRR Forecast = Existing MRR + New MRR - Churn MRR + Expansion MRR

Example:
Starting MRR: $100K
New MRR (pipeline): $15K
Churn MRR: -$8K (8% churn)
Expansion MRR: $5K (upsells)

Ending MRR: $100K + $15K - $8K + $5K = $112K

Key: Existing MRR is highly predictable, new MRR uses pipeline forecast
```

---

### B2B Services (Project-Based)

**Forecast by Project:**
```
Project Pipeline:
• Project A: $50K, 80% likely, closes March
• Project B: $30K, 50% likely, closes April
• Project C: $40K, 60% likely, closes March

March Forecast:
Project A: $50K × 80% = $40K
Project C: $40K × 60% = $24K
Total: $64K

Considerations:
• Project start date (revenue recognition)
• Payment terms (when cash received)
• Utilization (can team deliver?)
```

---

### E-commerce / Transactional

**Use historical trends:**
```
Average Monthly Revenue (last 12 months): $50K
Seasonality factor (December = 2x, June = 0.8x)

December Forecast: $50K × 2.0 = $100K
June Forecast: $50K × 0.8 = $40K

Plus pipeline:
• Big client launch: $20K (50% likely)
• New product release: $15K (70% likely)

June Total Forecast: $40K + $10K + $10.5K = $60.5K
```

---

## Scenario Planning

### Build 3 Scenarios

**Conservative (70% confidence):**
```
Assumptions:
• Only Commit category closes
• Win rate: 20% (below average)
• No expansion

Revenue: $30K
```

**Realistic (50% confidence):**
```
Assumptions:
• Commit + Best Case closes
• Win rate: 30% (average)
• Some expansion: $5K

Revenue: $75K
```

**Stretch (20% confidence):**
```
Assumptions:
• All pipeline closes faster
• Win rate: 40% (above average)
• Strong expansion: $15K

Revenue: $120K
```

**How to use:**
- Plan hiring/spending based on Conservative
- Set team goals based on Realistic
- Incentivize team for Stretch

---

## Common Forecasting Mistakes

### ❌ Sandbagging (Under-Forecasting)

**Problem:** Sales rep forecasts $30K, actually closes $50K
**Why:** Wants to look good by beating forecast
**Fix:** Separate forecast from quota, no penalty for accurate forecast

### ❌ Overconfidence (Over-Forecasting)

**Problem:** Every deal marked 80% likely
**Why:** Optimism bias, pressure to show big pipeline
**Fix:** Use historical win rates, calibrate probabilities

### ❌ Ignoring Deal Age

**Problem:** Deals sit in pipeline for 6+ months
**Why:** Hard to admit deal is dead
**Fix:** Auto-disqualify deals >90 days old without activity

### ❌ Not Updating Pipeline

**Problem:** Pipeline from 3 months ago, no recent activity
**Why:** CRM hygiene is boring
**Fix:** Weekly pipeline reviews (30 min), mandatory updates

### ❌ Confusing Pipeline with Forecast

**Problem:** "We have $500K pipeline!" (but win rate is 20%)
**Why:** Pipeline = potential, forecast = realistic
**Fix:** Always show weighted forecast, not just pipeline value

## Pipeline Health Checklist

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Update all deal stages (move forward or disqualify)
- [ ] Review deals closing this week (remove blockers)
- [ ] Check stale deals (>30 days, take action)
- [ ] Add new opportunities (maintain coverage)
- [ ] Update forecast (adjust probabilities)

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Review win/loss reasons (improve processes)
- [ ] Analyze stage conversion rates (identify bottlenecks)
- [ ] Check forecast accuracy (calibrate probabilities)
- [ ] Calculate pipeline coverage (3x target?)
- [ ] Review pipeline sources (where are deals coming from?)

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Deep dive on lost deals (competitive analysis)
- [ ] Refine stage definitions (still accurate?)
- [ ] Benchmark metrics (industry comparisons)
- [ ] Forecast next quarter (build scenarios)
- [ ] Set pipeline generation targets

**Time Investment:**
```
Setup: 8 hours (CRM, reports, process)
Ongoing: 2 hours/week (pipeline review, updates)

Annual: ~100 hours
```

**Impact:**
```
Without forecasting:
• Surprised by revenue miss
• Can't plan hiring ($100K mistake)
• Miss pipeline gaps early
• Reactive decisions

With forecasting:
• Predict revenue 3 months ahead (85% accuracy)
• Plan hiring at right time
• Identify gaps with 6 weeks to fix
• Proactive decisions

Value: Avoid $50-100K in bad decisions (hiring too early, running out of cash)
ROI: 500-1000x time invested
```
