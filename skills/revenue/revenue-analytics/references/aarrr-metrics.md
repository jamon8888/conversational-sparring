# AARRR (Pirate Metrics) Framework

## Overview
The AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral) provides a complete view of the customer lifecycle and growth metrics.

## The 5 Stages

### 1. Acquisition
**Definition**: How users find you

**Key Metrics**:

- Sign-ups
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Traffic by channel

**Channels**:
- Organic search (SEO)

- Social media
- Content marketing
- Referrals
- Direct

**Benchmarks**:
```
B2B SaaS:
- CPA: $100-$500
- Conversion rate (visitor → signup): 2-5%

B2C SaaS:
- CPA: $10-$100
- Conversion rate: 5-15%
```

**Optimization**:
- Improve SEO rankings
- Optimize ad targeting
- A/B test landing pages
- Reduce friction in signup

### 2. Activation
**Definition**: Users have a great first experience

**Key Metrics**:

- Time to first value
- Onboarding completion rate
- Feature adoption rate

**Activation Milestones**:
```
SaaS Product:
- Account created ✓
- Profile completed ✓
- First project created ✓
- First action completed ✓
- Invited team member ✓
```

**Benchmarks**:
```
Activation Rate: 30-50%
Time to Value: <5 minutes
Onboarding Completion: 40-60%
```

**Optimization**:
- Simplify onboarding
- Interactive tutorials
- Quick wins (aha moments)
- Personalized setup

### 3. Retention
**Definition**: Users come back and continue using

**Key Metrics**:
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Retention rate (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)
- Churn rate
- Customer lifetime

**Retention Curves**:
```
Day 1: 100% (all new users)
Day 7: 40-60% (good retention)
Day 30: 20-40% (healthy product)
Day 90: 15-30% (sticky product)
```

**Cohort Retention**:
```
Jan 2024 Cohort:
- Month 1: 100%
- Month 2: 85%
- Month 3: 75%
- Month 6: 60%
- Month 12: 50%
```

**Benchmarks**:
```
B2B SaaS:
- Monthly churn: <5%
- Annual retention: >90%

B2C SaaS:
- Monthly churn: <10%
- Annual retention: >70%
```

**Optimization**:
- Email re-engagement
- In-app notifications
- New feature releases

### 4. Revenue
**Definition**: Users pay for value

**Key Metrics**:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Conversion rate (free → paid)

**Revenue Formulas**:
```
MRR = # Paying Customers × ARPU
ARR = MRR × 12
ARPU = Total Revenue / # Customers
LTV = ARPU × Avg Customer Lifetime × Gross Margin %
```

**Example**:
```
Customers: 1,000
ARPU: $50/month
MRR: 1,000 × $50 = $50,000
ARR: $50,000 × 12 = $600,000
```

**Benchmarks**:
```
Free → Paid Conversion:
- Freemium: 2-5%
- Free trial: 15-25%

ARPU Growth:
- Target: 10-20% annually
- Via: Upsells, cross-sells, price increases
```

**Optimization**:
- Optimize pricing tiers
- Upsell/cross-sell campaigns
- Annual billing discounts
- Usage-based pricing

### 5. Referral
**Definition**: Users recommend you to others

**Key Metrics**:
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Referral rate (% of customers who refer)
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- Referral conversion rate

**Viral Coefficient Formula**:
```
K = (# Invites per User) × (Conversion Rate of Invites)

Example:
- Each user invites 5 people
- 20% of invites convert
- K = 5 × 0.20 = 1.0

K > 1.0 = Viral growth
K < 1.0 = Paid growth needed
```

**NPS Calculation**:
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

Example:
- 50% Promoters
- 10% Detractors
- NPS = 50 - 10 = 40

Benchmarks:
- Excellent: >50
- Good: 30-50
- Average: 0-30
```

**Optimization**:
- Referral incentives (both sides)
- Easy sharing mechanisms
- Social proof
- Exceptional product experience

## Optimization Priorities

### Stage-by-Stage Focus

**Early Stage** (Pre-Product/Market Fit):
1. **Activation** (most important)
2. Retention
3. Acquisition
4. Revenue
5. Referral

**Growth Stage** (Post-PMF):
1. **Acquisition** (scale what works)
2. Revenue (monetization)
3. Retention (reduce churn)
4. Referral (viral growth)
5. Activation (already optimized)

**Mature Stage**:
1. **Revenue** (maximize LTV)
2. Retention (defend base)
3. Referral (organic growth)
4. Acquisition (efficient CAC)
5. Activation (incremental gains)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Optimizing wrong stage**: Focusing on acquisition before activation
✅ **Sequential optimization**: Fix activation before scaling acquisition

❌ **Vanity metrics**: Total signups without activation
✅ **Actionable metrics**: Activated users who reach value

❌ **Ignoring retention**: Leaky bucket problem
✅ **Retention first**: Fix churn before adding more users

❌ **No segmentation**: Treating all users the same
✅ **Cohort analysis**: Track by segment, channel, time
