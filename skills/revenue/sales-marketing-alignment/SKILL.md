# Sales-Marketing Alignment

## Quick Start

This skill helps you align sales and marketing teams. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Creating SLAs

- [ ] Define MQL criteria (scoring model)
- [ ] Define SQL criteria (BANT qualified)
- [ ] Set SLA for marketing (X MQLs per month)
- [ ] Set SLA for sales (contact within Y hours)
- [ ] Create lead handoff process
- [ ] Set up feedback loop (accept/reject reasons)
- [ ] Track conversion rates (MQL→SQL→Won)
- [ ] Review quarterly and adjust

## Key Definitions

- **MQL**: Marketing Qualified Lead (scored >X, meets criteria)
- **SQL**: Sales Qualified Lead (BANT qualified, ready to buy)
- **SAL**: Sales Accepted Lead (sales agrees to work it)
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement (commitments between teams)

## Sample SLA

**Marketing commits:**

- Deliver 100 MQLs per month
- MQLs meet criteria (scoring >70)

**Sales commits:**

- Contact MQL within 24 hours
- Provide feedback (accept/reject reason)

## Quick Wins

- Weekly sales-marketing sync meeting
- Shared dashboard (conversions, pipeline)
- Close feedback loop (why leads rejected)
- Celebrate wins together
