# Agile Excellence & Metrics

## 1. Estimation & Readiness

- **Story Points**: Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Benchmarking against a "baseline" story.
- **Definition of Ready (DoR)**: Story is clearly defined, estimated, and has no external dependencies.
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Code reviewed, tests passed, doc updated, deployed to staging.

## 2. Sprint Health Indicators

- **Burndown Chart**: Measuring real-time progress against the ideal line.
- **Velocity Trend**: Assessing commitment reliability and capacity forecasting over 3+ sprints.
- **Impediment Latency**: Tracking how quickly blockers are resolved.

## 3. Team Health & Morale

- **Collaboration**: Quality of peer reviews and cross-functional participation.
- **Technical Debt**: Tracking "shortcut" tasks vs. refactoring initiatives.
- **Trust**: Openness during retrospectives and willingness to experiment with new processes.
