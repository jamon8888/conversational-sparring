## Overview
Turn a blog, video, or ebook into a 30-day social stream. Create optimized posts per platform, ensure tone consistency, and schedule the calendar.

## When to Use
- You want to generate a full month of social content from one asset
- You need cross-platform optimization (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube)

## What it Contains
- Platform-optimized posts
- Brand voice and tone checks
- Calendar and schedule plan

2) Optimize: platform_optimizer.py → per platform meta and constraints
3) Tone: tone_analyzer.py → brand voice pass
4) Schedule: content_calendar.py → export/suggested timing
5) Measure: unified-analytics social dashboard blocks
