# Content Pipeline Orchestration

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build automated content workflows. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building Content Pipeline

- [ ] Map current workflow (idea → publish)
- [ ] Choose project management tool (Airtable, Asana, Notion)
- [ ] Create content stages (Idea → Brief → Draft → Edit → SEO → Publish)
- [ ] Assign owners to each stage
- [ ] Set up automation (notifications, deadlines)
- [ ] Create templates (briefs, checklists)
- [ ] Track cycle time (days from idea to publish)
- [ ] Optimize bottlenecks

## Key Frameworks

- **Kanban Method**: Visualize workflow, limit work in progress, optimize flow
- **SLA-Based Workflow**: Set service level agreements for each stage (48hrs edit, 24hrs review)
- **Bottleneck Theory**: Identify and eliminate constraints in the pipeline
- **Content Operations Maturity Model**: Ad-hoc → Defined → Managed → Optimized

## Workflow Stages

1. **Ideation**: Keyword research, topic validation
2. **Planning**: Content brief creation
3. **Production**: Writing, design, multimedia
4. **Review**: Editing, SEO, fact-checking
5. **Publishing**: Scheduling, distribution
6. **Promotion**: Social, email, ads
7. **Analysis**: Performance tracking

## Quick Wins

- Use status tags (In Progress, Review, Ready, Published)
- Set SLAs (48hrs for edits, 24hrs for review)
- Auto-assign based on content type
- Weekly pipeline review meeting
