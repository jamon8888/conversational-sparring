# Hook-Story-Offer Framework

## Overview
A proven structure for social media posts that drives engagement and conversions.

## The Three Components

### 1. Hook (First 1-2 lines)
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll and grab attention

**Techniques**:
- **Bold claim**: "I analyzed 1,000 LinkedIn posts. 95% make this mistake."
- **Provocative question**: "Why do most LinkedIn posts fail?"
- **Contrarian take**: "Posting daily on LinkedIn is overrated."
- **Personal story**: "I lost $50K because I ignored this advice."
- **Pattern interrupt**: "Here's what nobody tells you about..."

**Best Practices**:
- Keep it under 150 characters
- Create curiosity gap
- Use specific numbers
- Avoid clickbait

### 2. Story (Middle section)
**Purpose**: Build credibility and provide value

**Formats**:
- **Personal experience**: Share your journey
- **Case study**: Show real results
- **Framework**: Teach a methodology
- **Lesson learned**: Extract wisdom from failure
- **Observation**: Share industry insights

**Structure**:
```
Problem → Attempt → Discovery → Result
```

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific (names, numbers, dates)
- Show vulnerability
- Include dialogue when relevant
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)

### 3. Offer (Final CTA)
**Purpose**: Drive specific action

**Types**:
- **Engagement**: "What's your experience with this?"
- **Content**: "I wrote a full guide on this: [link]"
- **Lead gen**: "Download my free template: [link]"
- **Sales**: "Want help with this? DM me."
- **Follow**: "Follow for more insights like this."

**Best Practices**:
- One clear action
- Make it easy
- Provide value first
- Use soft language ("might", "could")

## Example: LinkedIn Post

**Hook**:
> I spent $10K on LinkedIn ads and got zero leads.
> 
> Then I changed one thing and generated 50 qualified leads in 30 days.

**Story**:
> The problem wasn't my targeting or budget.
> 
> It was my landing page.
> 
> I was sending cold traffic to a generic "Book a Demo" page.
> 
> Here's what I changed:
> 
> 1. Created a specific lead magnet (not a demo)
> 2. Matched the ad copy to the landing page headline
> 3. Added social proof from LinkedIn testimonials
> 
> Result: 15% conversion rate (vs. 0.5% before)

**Offer**:
> Want my exact landing page template?
> 
> Comment "TEMPLATE" and I'll send it to you.
