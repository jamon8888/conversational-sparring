---

## When to Use This Skill

- Building personal brand on social media
- Creating daily/weekly social content
- Growing LinkedIn or Twitter following
- Driving engagement and conversations
- Generating inbound leads from social
- Repurposing long-form content

---

## Core Framework: Hook-Story-Offer

Every high-performing social post follows this structure:

### **Hook** (First 1-2 lines)
**Goal:** Stop the scroll

**Techniques:**
- Bold statement ("Most founders fail at cold outreach.")
- Surprising stat ("80% of sales happen after the 5th follow-up.")
- Relatable problem ("Your LinkedIn posts get 3 likes. All from your mom.")
- Question ("What if I told you cold email still works in 2025?")
- Contrarian take ("Stop posting daily on LinkedIn.")

**Examples:**
```
✅ "I closed $2M in deals without a single cold call."
✅ "Your cold emails aren't working. Here's why:"
✅ "Most sales advice is terrible. Do this instead:"
✅ "I analyzed 1,000 LinkedIn posts. Here's what actually works:"
```

---

### **Story** (Middle 5-10 lines)
**Goal:** Build connection + provide value

**Structure:**
- Context (the situation)
- Conflict (the challenge)
- Resolution (what you learned/did)
- Insight (the takeaway)

**OR tactical value:**
- Framework breakdown
- Step-by-step process
- Mistakes to avoid
- Tools/resources

**Example (Story-based):**
```
Last year, I sent 500 cold emails.
Got 2 replies. Both said "not interested."

I was ready to give up on outbound entirely.

Then I changed one thing: personalization.

Instead of "I noticed your company..." I wrote:
"Saw you posted about [specific thing]. Here's what worked for us..."

Reply rate jumped from 0.4% to 12%.
```

**Example (Tactical):**
```
Here's the framework I use:

S - Subject (3-6 words, create curiosity)
P - Personalize (reference specific trigger)
A - Agitate (state the pain)
R - Result (share proof)
K - Keep it simple (one clear CTA)

Used this to close $500K+ in pipeline.
```

---

### **Offer** (Last 1-3 lines)
**Goal:** Drive action

**Types of CTAs:**
- **Engagement:** "What's worked for you?" (drives comments)
- **Resource:** "DM me 'template' for the full guide" (builds list)
- **Lead gen:** "Free cold email templates in my bio" (drives traffic)
- **Soft sell:** "Want help with this? Let's chat" (starts conversations)
- **Social proof:** "Helped 50+ founders do this. You're next."

**Examples:**
```
✅ "What's your biggest cold email challenge? Drop a comment."
✅ "Want the full framework? Link in comments."
✅ "DM me 'SPARK' and I'll send you the template."
✅ "Repost this if it helped ♻️"
```

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### LinkedIn

**Post formats that work:**
1. **Personal stories** (lessons learned, failures, wins)
2. **Tactical frameworks** (step-by-step processes)
3. **Contrarian takes** (challenge conventional wisdom)
4. **Listicles** ("5 ways to...", "3 mistakes...")
5. **Case studies** (specific results with numbers)

**Optimal post length:**
- **Short-form:** 100-200 words (quick insights)
- **Medium-form:** 200-400 words (storytelling)
- **Long-form:** 400-800 words (deep dives)

**Best practices:**
- **Post 3-5 times per week** (consistency > volume)
- **First 2 lines are CRITICAL** (hook or they scroll)
- **Line breaks:** 1-2 sentences per line (mobile-friendly)
- **Emojis sparingly:** One per post max (professional)
- **Tag strategically:** Only relevant people (don't spam)
- **Engage in first hour:** Reply to every comment

**Post structure template:**
```
[Hook - bold statement or question]

[Blank line]

[Context - set up the story]
[Conflict - the challenge]
[Resolution - what happened]

[Blank line]

[Insight - the lesson]

[Blank line]

[Tactical takeaway - specific tip]

[Blank line]

[CTA - question to drive comments]
```

### LinkedIn Post Types

#### 1. Personal Story Post
```
I got fired from my first sales job.

My manager said: "You'll never make it in sales."

That was 5 years ago.

Last month, I closed $1M in ARR.

Here's what changed:

→ I stopped pitching. Started listening.
→ I stopped chasing everyone. Qualified ruthlessly.
→ I stopped winging it. Built repeatable systems.

The lesson?

Your current situation isn't your final destination.

What's one "failure" that made you better?
```

---

#### 2. Framework Post
```
I analyzed 500 cold emails.

Here's the 5-part framework the best performers used:

1️⃣ Subject: 3-6 words, create curiosity
→ "Quick question about X"
→ "Noticed you're hiring"

2️⃣ Personalize: Reference specific trigger
→ LinkedIn post, funding, hire

3️⃣ Agitate: Quantify the pain
→ "Most VPs spend 10+ hours/week on..."

4️⃣ Result: Social proof + metric
→ "We helped [Company] achieve [X] in [Y] time"

5️⃣ Keep it simple: One clear CTA
→ "Worth a 15-minute call?"

SPARK Framework.

Saved you years of trial and error.

What's your cold email strategy?
```

---

#### 3. Contrarian Take Post
```
Unpopular opinion:

Posting on LinkedIn every day is overrated.

Here's why:

→ Quality > Quantity
→ 3 great posts/week > 7 mediocre posts/week
→ Engagement matters more than volume

What actually works:

• Post 3-4 times per week
• Make each post valuable (not filler)
• Spend 50% of time engaging (comments, DMs)
• Build relationships, not just followers

I went from posting daily (burned out, low engagement)
to 3x/week (sustainable, 10x engagement).

Agree or disagree?
```

---

#### 4. Listicle Post
```
5 cold email mistakes that kill your reply rate:

1️⃣ Generic subject lines
→ Don't: "Introduction"
→ Do: "Quick question about your Q2 hiring"

2️⃣ Talking about yourself
→ Don't: "We're a leading platform..."
→ Do: "Saw you're scaling your SDR team..."

3️⃣ No social proof
→ Don't: "We can help you"
→ Do: "We helped [Company] achieve [Result]"

4️⃣ Multiple CTAs
→ Don't: "Can we chat? Or I can send info?"
→ Do: "Worth a 15-minute call?"

5️⃣ Too long
→ Don't: 200+ words
→ Do: 50-100 words max

Fix these → 10x your reply rate.

Which mistake are you making?
```

### Twitter/X

**Post formats that work:**
1. **Single tweets** (quick insights, hot takes)
2. **Threads** (step-by-step guides, stories)
3. **Quote tweets** (add commentary to others' content)
4. **Polls** (engagement, audience research)

**Character limits:**
- **Single tweet:** 280 characters
- **Threads:** Break into 5-15 tweets

**Best practices:**
- **Post 5-10 times per day** (high volume platform)
- **Mix formats:** 60% value, 30% engagement, 10% personal
- **Use threads** for longer content
- **Reply to others:** Spend 50% time engaging
- **Hashtags:** 1-2 max (not as important as LinkedIn)

---

### Twitter Thread Structure

**Thread template:**
```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
[Bold claim or question]

[Optional: "Here's what I learned 🧵"]

Tweet 2 (Context):
[Set up the story or problem]

Tweet 3-8 (Value):
[Break down the framework, steps, or story]

Tweet 9 (Summary):
[Recap the key takeaway]

Tweet 10 (CTA):
[Ask for engagement or share resource]

"If this helped, RT the first tweet ♻️"
"Follow me @[handle] for more on [topic]"
```

---

### Twitter Thread Example

```
Tweet 1:
I closed $2M in deals last year without a single cold call.

Here's the exact cold email framework I used: 🧵

Tweet 2:
Most cold emails fail because they're about YOU, not THEM.

Your prospect doesn't care about your "industry-leading platform."

They care about THEIR problems.

Tweet 3:
The SPARK Framework:

S - Subject (3-6 words)
P - Personalize
A - Agitate pain
R - Result/proof
K - Keep CTA simple

Let me break it down:

Tweet 4:
S - Subject Line

Keep it short. Create curiosity.

Examples:
• "Quick question about [X]"
• "Noticed you're hiring"
• "Idea for Q2"

Don't: "Introduction to our platform"

Tweet 5:
P - Personalize

Reference something specific.

• LinkedIn post
• Company news
• Hiring announcement

Shows you did research.

"Saw you're hiring 3 SDRs. Congrats on growth!"

Tweet 6:
A - Agitate the Pain

Quantify the problem.

"Most VPs tell us new reps take 90+ days to ramp—brutal when you need pipeline NOW."

Make them feel it.

Tweet 7:
R - Result

Show proof. Name names.

"We helped [Company] cut ramp to 45 days. Q2 class hit quota 60% faster."

Social proof > your claims.

Tweet 8:
K - Keep CTA Simple

ONE ask only.

✅ "Worth a 15-min call?"
❌ "Can we chat? Or I can send info? Or schedule demo?"

Make it easy to say yes.

Tweet 9:
That's it.

SPARK = 10x reply rates.

Used this to close $2M+ in pipeline.

You can too.

Tweet 10:
Want the full template + examples?

DM me "SPARK" and I'll send it over.

Follow @[handle] for more sales frameworks.

RT if this was helpful ♻️
```

## Engagement Tactics

### How to Get More Comments

**Ask specific questions:**
```
❌ "What do you think?"
✅ "What's your biggest cold email challenge?"

❌ "Agree?"
✅ "Agree or disagree: Cold calling is dead in 2025?"
```

**Use polls (Twitter):**
```
"What's your reply rate on cold emails?

🔵 0-5%
🟡 5-10%
🟢 10-15%
⚫ 15%+"
```

**Invite disagreement:**
```
"Unpopular opinion: [Contrarian take]

Tell me I'm wrong 👇"
```

---

### How to Get More Shares

**Make content "steal-worthy":**
- Frameworks people can reuse
- Templates they can copy
- Stats they can quote
- Graphics they can save

**Ask for repost:**
```
"If this helped, RT ♻️"
"Repost this if you agree ♻️"
"Share this with someone who needs it"
```

**Create carousel posts (LinkedIn):**
- 5-10 slide decks
- Highly shareable
- Higher reach than text posts

---

## Content Formats That Perform

### LinkedIn Carousel Posts

- Post carousel directly to LinkedIn

---

## Analytics & Optimization

### Metrics to Track

- **Followers:** Growth rate

**Twitter:**
- **Impressions**
- **Engagement rate:** (Likes + RTs + replies) / impressions

---

### Content Testing Framework

**Test one variable at a time:**

**Hook types:**
- Bold statement vs. question vs. stat
- Which gets more engagement?

**Post length:**
- Short (100 words) vs. long (400 words)
- Does length matter?

**CTA types:**
- Engagement ask vs. resource offer
- Which drives more comments/DMs?

**Posting time:**
- Morning (8-10am) vs. midday (12-2pm) vs. evening (4-6pm)
- When does your audience engage most?

**Track results for 4 weeks** then double down on what works.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ No clear hook
**Problem:** People scroll past
**Fix:** First 1-2 lines must grab attention

### ❌ Wall of text
**Problem:** Unreadable on mobile
**Fix:** 1-2 sentences per line, add white space

### ❌ Too salesy
**Problem:** Looks like spam
**Fix:** 90% value, 10% promotion

### ❌ No engagement
**Problem:** One-way broadcast
**Fix:** Reply to every comment within 1 hour

### ❌ Inconsistent posting
**Problem:** Algorithm buries you
**Fix:** Post 3-5x/week minimum

### ❌ Ignoring analytics
**Problem:** Don't know what works
**Fix:** Review weekly, double down on winners

---

## Pro Tips

### Golden Hour Engagement
First 1 hour after posting is critical:
- Reply to EVERY comment
- Like every comment
- Ask follow-up questions
- Algorithm rewards early engagement

### Borrow Authority
Quote or tag industry leaders:
```
"As @[expert] said: '[quote]'

Here's what I've learned applying this..."
```
They might engage, exposing you to their audience.

### The 1-3-30 Rule
For every 1 post you make:
- Comment on 3 others' posts
- Spend 30 minutes engaging

Build relationships, not just followers.

### Save High-Performers
Create a swipe file of your best posts:
- What hook worked?
- What structure?
- What CTA?
Reuse winning formulas.

### Use Scheduling Tools
**LinkedIn:** Buffer, Hootsuite
**Twitter:** Typefully, Tweet Hunter, Buffer

Batch create, schedule, engage daily.
