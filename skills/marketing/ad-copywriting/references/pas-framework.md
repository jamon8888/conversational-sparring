# PAS Framework for Ad Copy

## Overview
PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution) is a copywriting framework designed to create urgency and drive clicks in paid advertising.

## The Three Components

### 1. Problem
**Goal**: Identify the pain point your audience is experiencing

**Techniques**:
- **Direct statement**: "Struggling to generate leads?"
- **Question format**: "Tired of wasting money on ads that don't convert?"
- **Observation**: "Most B2B companies waste 60% of their ad budget."

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific (not "marketing is hard" but "cold email reply rates below 2%")
- Use their language (how they describe the problem)
- Make it relatable (common scenario)

### 2. Agitate
**Goal**: Amplify the pain and create urgency

**Techniques**:
- **Cost of inaction**: "Every day without a system costs you $500 in lost revenue."
- **Emotional impact**: "Watching competitors close deals while you struggle."
- **Time pressure**: "The longer you wait, the further behind you fall."

**Best Practices**:
- Don't be manipulative (genuine pain only)
- Use specific numbers when possible
- Connect to bigger consequences

### 3. Solution
**Goal**: Present your offer as the answer

**Components**:
- **What it is**: Brief description
- **Key benefit**: Main outcome
- **Proof element**: Social proof or guarantee
- **CTA**: Clear next step

**Best Practices**:
- Keep it simple (one main benefit)
- Include credibility marker
- Make CTA action-oriented
