# Sales Enablement & Collaboration
### 6.1 Sales Enablement Assets (Must-Have)

**Core Assets**:

**1. Sales Deck** (15-20 slides)

```
Slide 1: Title slide (logo, tagline)
Slide 2: Agenda
Slide 3: Company intro (mission, vision, traction)
Slide 4: Problem statement (customer pain points)
Slide 5: Solution overview (your product)
Slide 6: Key benefits (3-5 bullets)
Slide 7: Product demo (screenshots or video)
Slide 8: Differentiation (vs. competitors)
Slide 9: Customer logos (social proof)
Slide 10: Case study (results-focused)
Slide 11: Pricing and plans
Slide 12: Implementation timeline
Slide 13: Support and success
Slide 14: Next steps (CTA)
Slide 15: Q&A

Guidelines:
- Visual-first (minimal text, large images)
- Customer-centric (benefits > features)
- Modular (easy to skip/reorder slides)
- Updated quarterly (or after major product changes)
```

**2. One-Pagers** (1-page PDF)

- Product overview (what it is, who it's for, key features)
- Competitive comparison (vs. Competitor A, B, C)
- Case study (customer story with metrics)
- Pricing sheet (plans, features, add-ons)

**3. Battlecards** (per competitor)

- See Section 3.2 for detailed battlecard template

**4. Demo Script** (30-45 min)

```
Demo Flow:
1. Intro (2 min) - Who we are, what we'll cover
2. Discovery (5 min) - Ask about their needs, pain points
3. Demo (20 min) - Show product (focus on their use case)
4. Q&A (10 min) - Address objections, questions
5. Next steps (3 min) - Define trial or POC plan

Demo Tips:
- Show, don't tell (product in action > slides)
- Use customer data (not "Company XYZ" examples)
- Focus on outcomes (not features)
- Address objections proactively (price, competition)
- Always drive to next step (trial, POC, proposal)
```

**5. Email Templates** (HubSpot sequences)

- Cold outreach (prospecting)
- Demo follow-up
- Trial conversion
- Proposal sent
- Closing sequence

**6. ROI Calculator** (spreadsheet or web tool)

- Input: Customer's current costs, time spent, team size
- Output: Savings with your product, payback period, 3-year ROI
- Example: "Save $150k/year, 6-month payback, 500% ROI"
