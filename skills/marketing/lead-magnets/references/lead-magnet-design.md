# Lead Magnet Design Framework

## Overview
A systematic approach to creating lead magnets that convert visitors into subscribers.

## The Value Exchange Principle

**Core Concept**: The lead magnet must provide MORE value than the "cost" of giving an email address.

```
Perceived Value > Perceived Cost
```

**Perceived Value Factors**:
- Immediate usefulness
- Specificity of solution
- Professional presentation
- Social proof
- Scarcity/exclusivity

**Perceived Cost Factors**:
- Time to consume
- Effort to implement
- Risk of spam
- Privacy concerns
