# Storytelling

## Quick Start

This skill helps you craft compelling marketing narratives. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Crafting a Story

- [ ] Identify hero (customer, not your product)
- [ ] Define problem/conflict
- [ ] Show transformation journey
- [ ] Highlight turning point (your solution)
- [ ] Demonstrate results
- [ ] End with lesson/takeaway
- [ ] Add emotional elements

## Key Frameworks

- **Hero's Journey**: Ordinary world → Call to adventure → Challenges → Transformation → Return with treasure
- **Before-After-Bridge**: Before state → After state → Bridge (your solution)
- **Problem-Agitate-Solve**: Identify problem → Make it worse → Present solution
- **StoryBrand**: Character + Problem + Guide + Plan + Action + Success + Transformation

## Quick Wins

- Start with the conflict (hook readers immediately)
- Use specific numbers and details (makes it real)
- Show, don't tell (paint pictures with words)
- End with clear takeaway
