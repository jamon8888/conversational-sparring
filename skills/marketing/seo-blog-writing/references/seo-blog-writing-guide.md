## Step 1: Keyword Research

### Finding Keywords

**Tools (Free):**
- Google Autocomplete (type query + see suggestions)
- Google "People Also Ask"
- AnswerThePublic (question-based keywords)
- Google Trends (trending topics)
- Competitor analysis (see what they rank for)

**Tools (Paid):**
- Ahrefs (keyword difficulty, search volume)
- SEMrush (competitor keywords, gaps)
- Moz (keyword suggestions, SERP analysis)

### Keyword Criteria

Look for keywords with:
- **Search volume:** 100-1,000/month (sweet spot for small sites)
- **Keyword difficulty:** <30 (achievable without massive authority)
- **Commercial intent:** High (if goal is conversions)
- **Relevance:** Matches your expertise/product

### Keyword Types

**1. Primary Keyword (1 per post)**
- Main focus of the article
- In title, URL, H1, first paragraph
- Example: "cold email templates"

**2. Secondary Keywords (2-3 per post)**
- Related terms you'll naturally mention
- In H2s and throughout body
- Example: "email outreach examples," "B2B email scripts"

**3. Long-Tail Keywords (5-10 per post)**
- Specific phrases with lower competition
- Answer specific questions
- Example: "cold email template for SaaS sales"

---

### Search Intent Analysis

Before writing, understand WHAT searchers want:

**4 Types of Search Intent:**

**1. Informational (Learning)**
- Query: "What is cold email?"
- What they want: Definition, explanation, basics
- Content type: Guide, tutorial, explainer

**2. Navigational (Finding)**

- What they want: Specific resource or brand
- Content type: Resource page, tool comparison

**3. Transactional (Buying)**
- Query: "Best cold email software"
- What they want: Product recommendations, comparisons
- Content type: Reviews, comparison guides, product pages

**4. Commercial Investigation (Researching)**
- Query: "Cold email software vs. LinkedIn outreach"
- What they want: Options, pros/cons
- Content type: Comparison posts, "best of" lists

**How to identify intent:**
1. Google your target keyword
2. Look at top 10 results
3. Note the content type (guide, list, comparison, etc.)
4. Match that format in your content

---

## Step 3: Writing SEO-Optimized Content

### Title Tag Optimization

**Formula:**
```
[Primary Keyword] [Modifier]: [Benefit/Number] ([Year])
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Cold Email Templates That Convert: 15 Examples (2025)"
- ✅ "How to Write Cold Emails: Complete Guide for Beginners"
- ✅ "Best CRM for Small Business: Top 10 Compared (2025)"

**Best practices:**
- **Length:** 50-60 characters (or Google truncates)
- **Primary keyword:** At the beginning
- **Compelling:** Include number, benefit, or year
- **Unique:** Don't duplicate titles across pages

---

### Meta Description

**Formula:**
```
[Promise]. Learn [benefit] + [benefit]. [Social proof or credibility]. [CTA].
```

**Example:**
```
"Get 15% reply rates with our proven cold email templates. Learn the SPARK framework + see 10 real examples that closed deals. Free download included. Read now →"
```

**Best practices:**
- **Length:** 150-160 characters
- **Include keyword:** Bolded in search results
- **Compelling CTA:** "Learn how," "Get started," "Read now"
- **Sell the click:** Why should they click YOUR result?

---

### URL Structure

**Format:**
```
domain.com/[primary-keyword]
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ `yoursite.com/cold-email-templates`
- ✅ `yoursite.com/seo-blog-writing-guide`
- ❌ `yoursite.com/blog/post-12345`
- ❌ `yoursite.com/how-to-write-the-best-cold-emails-that-convert-in-2025`

**Best practices:**
- **Short:** 3-5 words
- **Lowercase:** Hyphens, not underscores
- **Keyword:** Include primary keyword
- **No dates:** Don't include year in URL (so you can update)

---

### Header Hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)

**Structure:**
```
H1: [Primary Keyword] (Title - only ONE per page)
  H2: Main Section 1
    H3: Subsection 1
    H3: Subsection 2
  H2: Main Section 2
    H3: Subsection 1
  H2: Main Section 3
```

**Best practices:**
- **H1:** Only one per page (your title)
- **H2:** Include secondary keywords
- **H3:** Natural subheadings, don't force keywords
- **Descriptive:** Tell readers what each section covers
- **Scannable:** Most readers skim headers first

**Example:**
```
H1: Cold Email Templates That Get 15% Reply Rates
H2: What Makes a Cold Email Effective?
H2: The SPARK Framework for Cold Emails
  H3: S - Subject Line Hooks
  H3: P - Personalized Opening
  H3: A - Agitate the Problem
  H3: R - Relevant Value Prop
  H3: K - Keep-it-Simple CTA
H2: 10 Cold Email Templates (With Examples)

```

---

### Keyword Placement

**Where to include your primary keyword:**
- ✅ Title (H1)
- ✅ URL
- ✅ Meta description
- ✅ First paragraph (within first 100 words)
- ✅ At least one H2
- ✅ Image alt text
- ✅ Throughout content (naturally, 1-2% density)
- ✅ Conclusion

**Where to include secondary keywords:**
- ✅ H2 and H3 headers
- ✅ Throughout body content
- ✅ Image filenames and alt text
- ✅ Internal link anchor text

**Keyword density:**
- **Target:** 1-2% (not more)
- **Example:** 2,000-word post = use primary keyword 20-40 times
- **Natural:** Don't force it; use synonyms and variations

---

### First Paragraph Formula

**Hook + Promise + Keyword:**

```
[Hook: Problem or compelling question]

[Promise: What they'll learn]

[Keyword: Naturally worked into promise]

[Credibility: Why trust you]
```

**Example:**
```
80% of sales reps give up after just 2 follow-up emails. Yet research shows that 80% of sales require 5+ touchpoints to convert.

In this guide, you'll learn how to write cold email templates that get 15% reply rates—10x the industry average.

I'll share the exact SPARK framework we use to close $2M+ in deals annually, plus 10 proven templates you can steal.

**Best practices:**

- **Descriptive anchor text:** Use keywords, not "click here"
- **Link to relevant content:** Related topics
- **Update old posts:** Link to new content

**Example:**
```
✅ "Check out our [cold email templates] for more examples."
❌ "Click [here] for templates."
```

**Linking hierarchy:**
```
Homepage
  ↓
Pillar Pages (main topics)
  ↓
Cluster Content (subtopics)

Supporting Content (specific questions)
```

---

### External Linking

**Best practices:**

**Example:**
```
"According to a [HubSpot study](link), personalized emails improve click-through rates by 14%."
```

---

### Image Optimization

**File names:**
```
✅ cold-email-template-example.jpg
❌ IMG_12345.jpg
```

**Alt text:**
```
✅ "Cold email template using SPARK framework showing subject line and body"
❌ "Image"
❌ "" (empty)
```

**Best practices:**
- **Compress images:** Use TinyPNG, ShortPixel (< 100KB)
- **Descriptive filenames:** Include keywords
- **Alt text:** Describe image + include keyword naturally
- **Captions:** Optional, but great for SEO
- **Responsive:** Mobile-optimized

---

### Readability Optimization
