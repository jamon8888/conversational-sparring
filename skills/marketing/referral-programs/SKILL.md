# Referral Programs

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build referral programs. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building Referral Program

- [ ] Choose incentive structure (double-sided)
- [ ] Design referral flow (easy sharing)
- [ ] Create referral tracking
- [ ] Build landing page for referrals
- [ ] Promote to existing users
- [ ] Track referral metrics (K-factor)
- [ ] Optimize conversion
- [ ] Prevent fraud/abuse

## Incentive Models

- **Double-sided**: Reward both referrer and referee
- **Credits**: Dropbox (500MB for both)
- **Cash**: Uber ($10 for both)
- **Discounts**: 1 month free for both

## Key Metrics

- **K-factor**: (Invites sent × Conversion rate) = viral coefficient
- **Target**: K > 1 = viral growth
- **Referral Rate**: % of users who refer
- **Conversion Rate**: % of referrals who sign up

## Quick Wins

- Double-sided incentives (motivate both)
- Easy sharing (one-click invite)
- Highlight in onboarding
- Track with unique referral codes
