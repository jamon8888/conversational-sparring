# Campaign Orchestration

This skill helps you plan and execute multi-channel content campaigns. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Running a Campaign

- [ ] Define campaign goal (launch, promotion, awareness)
- [ ] Choose channels (blog, email, social, ads, PR)

- [ ] Set up tracking (UTMs, pixels)
- [ ] Launch campaign across channels
- [ ] Monitor performance daily

## Key Frameworks

- **Campaign Arc**: Tease → Announce → Educate → Convert → Celebrate
- **Channel Mix**: Owned (blog, email) + Earned (PR) + Paid (ads)

- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks pre-launch, 1-2 weeks peak, 1 week follow-up

## Quick Wins

- Create campaign brief template (goals, messaging, assets)
- Use project management tool (Asana, Trello)
