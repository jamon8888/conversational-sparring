## When to Use This Skill

- Scaling content production
- Maximizing content ROI
- Working with limited time
- Cross-platform distribution
- Amplifying reach
- Building content library fast
- Reducing creation burnout

---

## The Content Pyramid Framework

### Concept

Create ONE high-value pillar piece → Derive 10-20+ smaller assets

**Why it works:**
- 80% less effort than creating 20 separate pieces
- Consistent messaging across platforms
- One topic, multiple entry points
- Compound reach (same message, different audiences)

---

### The Pyramid Structure

```
           [PILLAR]
        (1 piece, 20hrs)
       /       |       \
    [TIER 2: Medium-Form]
   (3-5 pieces, 5hrs total)
          /  |  |  \
   [TIER 3: Micro-Content]
 (10-20 pieces, 3hrs total)
```

---

## Pillar Content (Top of Pyramid)

### What Is Pillar Content?

**Definition:** Comprehensive, long-form content that covers a topic in-depth

**Formats:**
- Blog post (3,000-5,000 words)
- YouTube video (20-40 min)
- Podcast episode (40-60 min)

- Ebook/Guide (20-50 pages)

**Time Investment:** 10-20 hours

---

### Choosing Pillar Topics

**Topic Criteria:**
- **Evergreen:** Relevant for months/years
- **Comprehensive:** Can be broken into 5-10 subtopics
- **High-value:** Solves significant problem
- **On-brand:** Aligns with your expertise

**Examples:**
```
✅ "The Complete Guide to Cold Email for B2B Sales"
  → Subtopics: Subject lines, personalization, follow-ups, templates, metrics

✅ "How to Build a $10K/Month Online Business from Scratch"
  → Subtopics: Idea validation, MVP, marketing, scaling, automation

❌ "3 Quick Marketing Tips" (not comprehensive enough)
```

---

### Pillar Content Creation Process

**Step 1: Outline (2 hours)**
```
Main Topic: [Topic]

Introduction: [Hook + Context]

Section 1: [Subtopic]
  - Key point 1
  - Key point 2
  - Example/case study

Section 2: [Subtopic]
  [Repeat structure]

[Continue for 5-10 sections]

Conclusion: [Summary + CTA]
```

**Step 2: Research (2-4 hours)**
- Gather data/stats
- Find examples
- Review competitors
- Collect quotes/testimonials

**Step 3: Create (10-15 hours)**

---

## Tier 2: Medium-Form Content

**Method:** Each pillar SECTION becomes a medium piece

**Example:**
```

Section 1: "Subject Lines" → Medium Post: "10 Subject Lines That Get 40%+ Open Rates"
Section 2: "Personalization" → Medium Post: "How to Personalize Cold Emails at Scale"

[etc.]
```

**Time Investment:** 1-2 hours per piece (mostly editing/reformatting)

---

## Tier 3: Micro-Content

### From 1 Pillar → 10-20+ Micro Pieces

**Formats:**
- Social media posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)

LinkedIn post:
```
I analyzed 1,000 cold emails.

The ones with personalized first lines got 3x higher reply rates.

Here's how to personalize at scale:

Pillar framework:
```
The SPARK Framework for Cold Emails:
S - Subject

Twitter thread:
```
Tweet 1: "The SPARK framework gets 15% reply rates. Here's how it works:"

## Maximizing Repurposing ROI

### Evergreen Content Selection

**Best ROI topics:**
- How-to guides (always relevant)
- Frameworks/systems (timeless)
- Case studies (reusable)
- Tool tutorials (update yearly)

**Low ROI topics:**
- Breaking news (outdated fast)
- Platform-specific changes (obsolete)
- Trends (short shelf life)

**Focus 80% on evergreen → Repurpose for years**

---

### Update & Re-Repurpose

**Annual Refresh:**
1. Update statistics (new data)
2. Add recent examples
3. Refresh format (new design)
4. Re-publish with "[2024 Update]"
5. Repurpose again (another 20-40 assets)

**Example:**
```
2023: "Complete Guide to Cold Email" → 40 assets
2024: Update with new stats → 40 NEW assets
2025: Refresh again → 40 MORE assets

Total: 120 assets from ONE pillar (over 3 years)
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Copy-Pasting Without Adapting
**Problem:** Blog post text copied directly to LinkedIn (wrong format)
**Fix:** Adapt for platform (shorter, conversational for social)

### ❌ Over-Repurposing Same Message
**Problem:** Audience sees same content 10x in one week (annoying)
**Fix:** Spread derivatives over 4-8 weeks

### ❌ No Platform Optimization
**Problem:** Horizontal video on TikTok (designed for vertical)
**Fix:** Resize/reformat for each platform

### ❌ Ignoring New Angles
**Problem:** All derivatives say exact same thing
**Fix:** Add new insights, examples, angles to each derivative

### ❌ Not Linking Back
**Problem:** Derivatives don't drive traffic to pillar
**Fix:** Always include link back to original

## Repurposing Checklist

**Before Repurposing:**
- [ ] Pillar content is high-quality (worth repurposing)
- [ ] Topic is evergreen (will last 12+ months)
- [ ] Pillar has 5-10 clear subtopics
- [ ] You own the content (not derivative of others)

**During Repurposing:**
- [ ] Adapt format for each platform
- [ ] Add value/new angle to derivatives
- [ ] Include CTA linking back to pillar
- [ ] Optimize for platform specs (size, length, format)

**After Repurposing:**
- [ ] Schedule across 4-8 weeks (not all at once)
- [ ] Track performance (which derivative formats work best)
- [ ] Iterate based on data

---

## Repurposing ROI

**Time Comparison:**

**Creating 20 separate pieces from scratch:**
```
20 LinkedIn posts × 30 min = 10 hours
10 short videos × 1 hour = 10 hours
5 blog posts × 3 hours = 15 hours

Total: 35 hours for 35 pieces
```

**Creating 1 pillar + repurposing:**
```
1 pillar: 15 hours
Repurposing: 6 hours

Total: 21 hours for 40 pieces
```

**Savings: 40% less time, 14% more output**
