## Core Framework: The Content Pyramid

Turn one pillar piece into 10+ derivative content assets:

```
         [1 Pillar Content]
         (Blog post, video, podcast)
                  ↓
    [3-5 Medium-Form Pieces]
    (LinkedIn articles, email series)
                  ↓
      [10-15 Micro-Content]
      (Social posts, quotes, threads)
                  ↓
        [Evergreen Assets]
        (Lead magnets, templates)
```

### Example:
**Pillar:** "Complete Guide to Sales Prospecting" (3,000-word blog)

**Derivatives:**
- 5 LinkedIn articles (600 words each on subtopics)
- 15 LinkedIn posts (one per key insight)
- 3 Twitter threads (tactical tips)
- 1 email series (5-part nurture)
- 1 lead magnet (prospecting template)
- 1 webinar (deep dive)

**Result:** 1 piece of research → 25+ content assets

## Content Strategy Process

### Step 1: Define Your Content Mission

**Answer these questions:**
- **Who are you creating content for?** (Target audience)
- **What problem do you solve?** (Value proposition)
- **Why should they care?** (Unique angle)
- **What action do you want them to take?** (Business goal)

**Template:**
```
"We create [content type] for [target audience] who struggle with [problem].
Our content helps them [desired outcome] so they can [business result].
Our unique angle is [differentiation]."
```

**Example:**
```
"We create tactical sales guides for B2B founders who struggle with prospecting.
Our content helps them generate consistent pipeline so they can hit revenue goals.
Our unique angle is frameworks over theory—everything is immediately actionable."
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Content Pillars (3-5 Core Topics)

**Pillars = recurring themes you'll become known for**

**How to choose:**
1. **Audience needs:** What are their top 3-5 pain points?
2. **Your expertise:** What can you teach better than anyone?
3. **Business goals:** What topics lead to conversions?
4. **Search demand:** What are people searching for?

**Example (B2B SaaS Sales):**
```
Pillar 1: Outbound Prospecting
Pillar 2: Discovery & Qualification
Pillar 3: Closing & Negotiation
Pillar 4: Sales Enablement & Tools
Pillar 5: Pipeline Management
```

**Content mix per pillar:**
- 40% Tactical (how-to guides, templates)
- 30% Strategic (frameworks, methodologies)
- 20% Thought leadership (trends, opinions)
- 10% Personal (stories, lessons learned)

---

### Step 3: Build Your Content Calendar

**Monthly planning framework:**

| Week | Pillar | Format | Topic | Distribution |
|------|--------|--------|-------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Prospecting | Blog (2K words) | "Cold Email Templates That Get 15% Reply Rates" | Blog → LinkedIn → Email |
| Week 2 | Discovery | Video (10 min) | "Discovery Call Framework (SPIN)" | YouTube → LinkedIn → Twitter clips |
| Week 3 | Closing | Case Study | "How We Closed a $100K Deal" | Blog → Email → LinkedIn |
| Week 4 | Pipeline | Guide | "Pipeline Management Checklist" | Lead magnet → LinkedIn promo |

**Cadence recommendations:**
- **Blog posts:** 1-2 per week (cornerstone content)
- **LinkedIn posts:** 3-5 per week (engagement)
- **Email newsletter:** 1 per week (nurture)
- **Twitter/X:** 5-10 per week (micro-content)
- **Lead magnets:** 1 per month (list building)

---

### Step 4: Apply the Content Pyramid

**How to maximize one pillar piece:**

**Start with pillar content:**
- Long-form blog post (2,000+ words)
- Podcast episode (30-45 min)
- Video tutorial (15-20 min)
- In-depth guide or case study

**Break it down:**
1. **Extract key insights** (10-15 standalone ideas)
2. **Create medium-form pieces** (3-5 LinkedIn articles, email series)
3. **Generate micro-content** (15-20 social posts, quotes, threads)
4. **Package as lead magnet** (template, checklist, toolkit)

**Distribution timeline:**
```
Day 1: Publish pillar content (blog post)
Day 2-3: Share 3 LinkedIn posts highlighting key insights
Day 4: Twitter thread with tactical tips
Day 5: Email newsletter featuring the post
Week 2: LinkedIn article diving deeper into one subtopic
Week 3: Create lead magnet (downloadable template)
Week 4: Webinar expanding on the topic
```

**Result:** 4-6 weeks of content from 1 research session

## Content Distribution Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule
- **20% creation** (writing, filming, recording)
- **80% distribution** (promoting, repurposing, amplifying)

### Multi-Channel Distribution Playbook

**For a single blog post:**

**Day 1: Publish & Promote**
- ✅ Publish on blog
- ✅ Share on LinkedIn (text post with link)
- ✅ Tweet with key insight + link
- ✅ Post in relevant communities (with value, not spam)
- ✅ Email to newsletter list

**Day 2-7: Amplify**
- ✅ Create 3-5 LinkedIn posts highlighting different insights
- ✅ Turn into Twitter thread
- ✅ Share in Slack communities
- ✅ Reddit (if genuinely helpful for the community)
- ✅ Repurpose as carousel (Instagram/LinkedIn)

**Week 2-4: Derivatives**
- ✅ LinkedIn article (deep dive on one subtopic)
- ✅ Email series (break into 5-part course)
- ✅ Lead magnet (template or checklist)
- ✅ Video (screen recording or talking head)

**Month 2-3: Refresh & Resurface**
- ✅ Update with new data/insights
- ✅ Re-share on social ("Updated guide")
- ✅ Internal link from new content
- ✅ Feature in newsletter again

---

## Content-Market Fit

**Measure these metrics to validate topics:**

| Metric | What It Means | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Pageviews** | Interest / reach | 500+ views per post |
| **Time on page** | Engagement / value | 3+ minutes |
| **Social shares** | Resonance | 20+ shares |
| **Comments** | Conversation | 5+ comments |
| **Backlinks** | Authority / SEO | 5+ backlinks over time |
| **Conversions** | Business impact | 2-5% of readers to lead/customer |

**If a topic performs well:**
- ✅ Create more content on that pillar
- ✅ Go deeper on subtopics
- ✅ Turn into lead magnet
- ✅ Create product/service around it

**If a topic underperforms:**
- ❌ Don't abandon immediately (takes 3-6 months to gain traction)
- ❌ Revisit angle or format
- ❌ Try different distribution channel
- ❌ After 3 attempts with no traction → deprioritize

---

## Batch Creation Workflow

**Time-block content creation:**

**Monday (3 hours): Research & Outlining**
- Research 4 topics for the month
- Create outlines for each
- Gather data, quotes, examples

**Tuesday (4 hours): Writing**
- Write 2 blog posts (2,000 words each)
- Use Pomodoro: 25 min writing, 5 min break

**Wednesday (2 hours): Derivative Content**
- Extract 10 social posts from each blog
- Create email newsletter
- Design 2-3 quote graphics

**Thursday (2 hours): Scheduling**
- Schedule all social posts for the month
- Queue email newsletters
- Set up blog publication dates

**Friday (1 hour): Engagement & Distribution**
- Engage with comments
- Share in communities
- Respond to DMs

**Total:** 12 hours/week → 1 month of content

## Content Repurposing Matrix

**One piece of content → many formats:**

| Original Format | Repurpose Into |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Blog Post** | LinkedIn article, email series, Twitter thread, quote graphics, podcast episode, video script |
| **Video** | Blog post transcript, audiogram clips, quote graphics, GIFs, Twitter clips |
| **Podcast** | Blog post, Twitter thread, quote graphics, audiograms, LinkedIn posts |
| **Case Study** | Landing page, ad copy, social proof, webinar content, sales deck slides |
| **Webinar** | Blog post, email series, recorded video, clips, slide deck download |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ No strategy, just posting
**Problem:** Random content with no cohesion
**Fix:** Define 3-5 pillars and stick to them

### ❌ Creating without distributing
**Problem:** Great content, zero views
**Fix:** Spend 80% of time on distribution

### ❌ Trying to be on every platform
**Problem:** Spread too thin, inconsistent
**Fix:** Pick 2 primary channels, dominate those first

### ❌ Not repurposing content
**Problem:** Reinventing the wheel weekly
**Fix:** Use Content Pyramid (1 piece → 10+ derivatives)

### ❌ Chasing viral, ignoring evergreen
**Problem:** Inconsistent results
**Fix:** 80% evergreen, 20% trending/timely

### ❌ No measurement
**Problem:** Don't know what works
**Fix:** Track pageviews, engagement, conversions per topic
