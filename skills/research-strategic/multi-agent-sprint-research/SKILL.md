# Multi-Agent Sprint Research

Comprehensive 6-task research sprints with parallel execution for strategic decision-making.

## When to Use

- Market entry decisions
- Strategic opportunity evaluation
- Comprehensive due diligence
- Major investment decisions
- Product launch research
- M&A evaluation

## Sprint Structure

### 6-Task Research Sprint (8-12 hours)

**Task 01: Technical/Regulatory Research** (2h)

- Standards and compliance requirements
- Technology landscape
- Regulatory considerations
- Certification pathways

**Task 02: Market Analysis** (3h)

- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Trend analysis
- Customer segments
- Growth projections

**Task 03: Competitive Intelligence** (2h)

- Competitor mapping
- Positioning analysis
- SWOT analysis
- Gap identification

**Task 04: Solution Architecture** (2h)

- Requirements synthesis
- Solution options
- Build vs buy analysis
- Integration considerations

**Task 05: Implementation Planning** (1.5h)

- Roadmap development
- Resource planning
- Risk mitigation
- Timeline estimation

**Task 06: Synthesis & Reporting** (1.5h)

- Cross-task synthesis
- Executive summary
- Presentation deck
- Recommendations

## Execution Model

### Parallel Execution

- Tasks 01-03 run in parallel (independent)
- Task 04 depends on Tasks 01-03 (synthesis)
- Task 05 depends on Task 04 (planning)
- Task 06 synthesizes all tasks (final)

### Quality Gates

- Each task has defined deliverables
- Quality review between phases
- Synthesis validates consistency
- Final review before stakeholder presentation

## Sprint Coordination

### Kickoff

1. Define research questions
2. Assign task owners (if team)
3. Set timeline and checkpoints
4. Establish success criteria

### Progress Tracking

- Track completion percentage per task
- Flag blockers early
- Adjust scope if needed
- Maintain quality standards

### Wrap-up

1. Consolidate deliverables
2. Quality review
3. Executive summary
4. Stakeholder presentation

## Deliverables

### Per Task

- Task-specific analysis
- Data and evidence
- Findings and insights
- Quality validation

### Sprint Output

- Executive summary (2-3 pages)
- Detailed research report (20-40 pages)
- Presentation deck (15-20 slides)
- Data appendices
- Recommendation with confidence levels

## Quality Standards

- **Citations**: 80%+ from primary sources
- **Methodology**: Documented for each task
- **Consistency**: Cross-task validation
- **Actionability**: Clear recommendations
- **Confidence**: Stated for all conclusions

## Integration with Other Skills

This sprint orchestrates:

- `market-analyst` for Task 02
- `comparative-analyzer` for Task 03
- `research-synthesizer` for Task 06
- `strategic-research-orchestrator` for playbook application
- `opportunity-scorer` for prioritization

## Example Sprint

**Research Question**: Should we enter the European medical device market?

**Sprint Plan**:

1. **Technical/Regulatory**: EU MDR compliance, CE marking
2. **Market Analysis**: European market size, growth rates
3. **Competitive**: Top 10 EU competitors, positioning
4. **Solution**: Distribution strategy, partnership options
5. **Implementation**: 18-month market entry roadmap
6. **Synthesis**: Go/no-go recommendation with evidence

**Timeline**: 10 hours
**Deliverable**: Executive brief + detailed report
