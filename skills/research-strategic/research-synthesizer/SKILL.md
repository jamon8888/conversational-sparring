# Research Synthesizer

Cross-task synthesis and insight extraction from multiple research streams.

## When to Use

- Synthesizing multi-task research
- Identifying cross-cutting patterns
- Resolving contradictory findings
- Creating executive summaries
- Storytelling from data
- Strategic insight generation

## Core Capabilities

### Pattern Identification

- Convergent insights (themes across tasks)
- Divergent findings (contradictions)
- Emergent opportunities (unexpected discoveries)
- Risk patterns (recurring concerns)

### Synthesis Frameworks

**Pyramid Principle:**

1. Lead with the answer
2. Group supporting arguments
3. Order logically
4. Support with evidence

**Strategic Narrative:**

1. **Context**: Where are we now?
2. **Challenge**: What's the problem?
3. **Insight**: What did we learn?
4. **Solution**: What should we do?
5. **Impact**: What will change?

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Cross-Task Synthesis

1. Review all research outputs
2. Identify common themes
3. Map contradictions
4. Extract key insights
5. Generate recommendations
6. Create executive summary

### Workflow 2: Contradiction Resolution

1. Identify conflicting findings
2. Assess source credibility
3. Examine methodology differences
4. Determine root cause
5. Resolve or acknowledge uncertainty

## Synthesis Patterns

### Pattern 1: Convergent Insights

- Market trends + Competitive gaps = Opportunity
- Technical capabilities + Customer needs = Solution

### Pattern 2: Tension Resolution

- Market says X, competitors do Y → Strategic choice
- Customers want A, technology enables B → Phased approach

### Pattern 3: Gap Analysis

- Unanswered questions
- Areas needing deeper investigation
- Assumptions to validate

## Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: All research tasks synthesized
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and narrative
- **Actionability**: Clear recommendations
- **Evidence**: Claims supported by research
- **Confidence**: Levels stated for each insight

## Deliverables

- Executive summary (1-2 pages)
- Key insights (3-5 bullets)
- Strategic recommendations
- Detailed synthesis report
- Presentation deck
- Next steps and open questions
