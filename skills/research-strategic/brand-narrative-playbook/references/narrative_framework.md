# Brand Narrative Framework

## The Narrative Arc
Every campaign or asset should follow this emotional journey:

### 1. The Context (Status Quo)
*What is the world like today for the audience?*
> "Teams are drowning in data but starving for insights."

### 2. The Tension (The Villain)
*What is the painful problem or shift that makes the status quo unsustainable?*
> "Manual reporting is too slow. By the time you find the answer, the question has changed."

### 3. The Resolution (The Hero/Solution)
*How do we uniquely solve this tension?*
> "Our platform automates insights in real-time, turning data into decisions instantly."

### 4. The Proof (Evidence)
*Why should they believe us?*
> "Used by 500+ enterprises. 99.9% uptime. SOC2 certified."

### 5. The Call to Action (Next Step)
*What do we want them to do?*
> "Start your free trial today."
