# Multi-Touch Cadence Framework

## Overview
A systematic approach to designing follow-up sequences that maximize response rates while respecting prospect time.

## Core Principles

### 1. The 7-Touch Rule
Research shows it takes 7-13 touches to generate a qualified lead. Most reps give up after 2-3.

**Optimal Cadence**: 7 touches over 14-21 days

### 2. Multi-Channel Approach
Don't rely on email alone. Mix channels for higher engagement.

**Channel Mix**:
- 40% Email
- 30% LinkedIn
- 20% Phone
- 10% Other (video, direct mail)

### 3. Value-Add Philosophy
Every touch should provide value, not just "checking in."

## Standard Cadence Structures

### 7-Touch Cadence (14 days)

**Day 0**: Email #1 - Initial outreach (SPARK framework)
**Day 2**: LinkedIn - View profile + connection request
**Day 4**: Email #2 - Value-add (share article/resource)
**Day 7**: Phone - Call attempt + voicemail
**Day 9**: LinkedIn - Comment on their post or send DM
**Day 11**: Email #3 - Different angle (new pain point)
**Day 14**: Email #4 - Breakup email

### 14-Touch Cadence (21 days)

**Day 0**: Email #1 - Initial outreach
**Day 1**: LinkedIn - View profile

**Day 17**: LinkedIn - Share relevant content
**Day 19**: Email #6 - Last value-add
**Day 21**: Phone - Final call
**Day 28**: Email #7 - Breakup

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too many touches too fast**: Feels spammy
✅ **Spaced appropriately**: Respectful persistence

❌ **Same message every time**: Boring
✅ **Different angles**: Fresh perspective each touch

❌ **No value-add**: Just "checking in"
✅ **Always provide value**: Resource, insight, or perspective

❌ **Give up too early**: 2-3 touches only
✅ **Persist intelligently**: 7+ touches with value
