# LinkedIn Engagement Ladder Framework

## Overview
A systematic approach to warming up cold prospects on LinkedIn before asking for a meeting.

## The Engagement Ladder

```
Level 5: Direct Ask (Meeting Request)
         ↑
Level 4: Direct Message (Value Conversation)
         ↑
Level 3: Engage with Content (Comment/Share)
         ↑
Level 2: Connect (Personalized Request)
         ↑
Level 1: Monitor (Profile View, Research)
```

**Rule**: Never skip rungs. Build familiarity before asking.

## Level 1: Monitor (Days 1-3)

[article/tool] on [topic]. Might be useful for
[their initiative]. Let me know what you think!

## Tools and Automation

- Meeting requests

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Skipping rungs**: Asking for meeting immediately
✅ **Climb gradually**: Build familiarity first

❌ **Generic engagement**: "Great post!"
✅ **Thoughtful engagement**: Add value or ask questions

❌ **Too aggressive**: Daily touches
✅ **Patient approach**: 2-3 touches per week

❌ **No value**: Just trying to sell
✅ **Value-first**: Help before asking
