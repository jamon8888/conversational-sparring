# Objection Handling

## Quick Start

This skill helps you handle sales objections effectively. For complete frameworks and responses, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Handling an Objection

- [ ] Listen fully (don't interrupt)
- [ ] Acknowledge concern (show empathy)
- [ ] Clarify root cause (ask questions)
- [ ] Explain solution (address directly)
- [ ] Confirm resolution (check understanding)

## Key Frameworks

- **LACE**: Listen → Acknowledge → Clarify → Explain
- **Common Objections**: Price, Timing, Authority, Need, Trust
- **Never argue**: Validate first, then address

## Common Objections & Responses

**"Too expensive"**

- Clarify: "Compared to what?"
- Reframe: Focus on ROI, not cost

**"Not the right time"**

- Clarify: "What would make it the right time?"
- Urgency: Cost of waiting

**"Need to think about it"**

- Clarify: "What specifically do you need to think about?"
- Address: Tackle the real concern

## Quick Wins

- Prepare responses to top 5 objections in advance
- Use stories (case studies) to overcome objections
- Never discount immediately (explore value first)
