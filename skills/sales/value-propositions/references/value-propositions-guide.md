## Overview
Craft executive-ready value narratives, ROI stories, and business cases for prospects. This skill helps you translate discovery insights into quantified impact stories that win deals and secure budget approval.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating proposals for qualified opportunities
- Building business cases for budget approval
- Preparing executive presentations
- Responding to RFPs with value narratives
- Justifying premium pricing
- Competing against cheaper alternatives

---

## Core Framework: Value Story Structure

Every compelling value proposition follows this hierarchy:

### 1. **Headline Impact**
State the quantified outcome upfront

**Format:**
```
[Prospect] will [achieve X outcome] in [timeframe] by [implementing solution]
```

**Examples:**
- "Acme Corp will save $500K annually in sales operations costs within 6 months"
- "Your team will increase pipeline velocity 40% and close 3 weeks faster within 90 days"
- "Eliminate 15 hours of manual work per rep per week starting Month 1"

**Why this works:**
- Grabs attention immediately
- Makes the outcome tangible
- Sets expectations for the story

---

### 2. **Driver Pillars**
Break impact into 3-4 specific drivers

**Structure:**
```
The $500K savings comes from:
1. [Driver 1]: $200K from reduced manual data entry
2. [Driver 2]: $180K from improved win rates
3. [Driver 3]: $120K from faster ramp time
```

**Requirements:**
- Must add up to headline impact
- Include supporting data or benchmarks
- Connect to discovery insights (their specific pain)

---

### 3. **Proof Layer**
Attach evidence to each driver

**Types of proof:**
- **Customer stories:** "[Similar Company] achieved [metric] in [timeframe]"
- **Product metrics:** "Our avg customer sees [outcome] within [timeline]"
- **Analyst stats:** "Gartner reports [industry benchmark]"
- **Internal data:** "Your current [metric] vs. benchmark"

**Example:**
```
Driver 1: $200K from reduced manual data entry
Proof: "SalesLoft eliminated 12 hours/week of data entry per rep using our automation. With 20 reps @ $75/hr, that's $936K annual savings for them."
```

---

### 4. **Execution Plan**
Outline how you'll deliver the value

**Include:**
- Implementation phases (30/60/90 days)
- Required resources (from their side + yours)
- Success metrics per phase
- Risk mitigation

**Template:**
```
Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Setup & onboarding
- Actions: [List]
- Resources: [List]
- Success metric: [Metric]

Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Rollout to pilot team
- Actions: [List]
- Success metric: [Metric]

Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Full deployment
- Success metric: [Full impact achieved]
```

---

### 5. **Decision Ask**
Specify what you need from them

**Format:**
```
To move forward, we need:
1. [Budget approval by date]
2. [Technical requirements met]
3. [Executive sponsor assigned]
4. [Timeline commitment]

Next step: [Specific action with date]
```

## ROI Calculation Templates

### Template 1: Time Savings
```
Current State:
- [X] reps spend [Y] hours/week on [manual task]
- Cost: [X reps] × [Y hrs/week] × [52 weeks] × [$Z hourly rate] = $[Total cost]

Future State:
- Solution automates [%] of [manual task]
- Time saved: [Y hrs/week] × [%] = [New hrs/week saved]
- Annual savings: [Hrs saved] × [52 weeks] × [$Z rate] = $[Annual savings]

ROI:
- Investment: $[Solution cost]
- Annual return: $[Savings]
- Payback period: [X months]
- 3-year ROI: [%]
```

**Example:**
```
Current State:
- 20 reps spend 10 hours/week on manual prospecting research
- Cost: 20 × 10 × 52 × $75/hr = $780,000/year

Future State:
- Our tool automates 80% of research
- Time saved: 10 hrs × 80% = 8 hrs/week per rep
- Annual savings: 8 × 52 × $75 × 20 = $624,000

ROI:
- Investment: $150,000 (Year 1)
- Annual return: $624,000
- Payback period: 2.9 months
- 3-year ROI: 316%
```

---

### Template 2: Revenue Impact
```
Current State:
- Win rate: [X%]
- Average deal size: $[Y]
- Sales cycle: [Z days]
- Opportunities/year: [N]
- Revenue: [N] × [X%] × $[Y] = $[Current revenue]

Future State:
- Win rate improves to: [X + A%] (via [specific improvement])
- Deal size increases to: $[Y + B] (via [specific improvement])
- Sales cycle decreases to: [Z - C days] (via [specific improvement])
- Additional revenue: $[Incremental revenue]

ROI:
- Investment: $[Solution cost]
- Incremental revenue (Year 1): $[Amount]
- Return: [X]× on investment
```

**Example:**
```
Current State:
- Win rate: 20%
- Avg deal: $50K
- Sales cycle: 90 days
- Opps/year: 400
- Revenue: 400 × 20% × $50K = $4M

Future State (based on similar customer benchmarks):
- Win rate: 28% (+8% via better qualification)
- Avg deal: $58K (+16% via value selling training)
- Sales cycle: 68 days (-22 days via process automation)
- Revenue: 400 × 28% × $58K = $6.5M

ROI:
- Investment: $200K
- Incremental revenue: $2.5M
- Return: 12.5× Year 1 ROI
```

---

### Template 3: Efficiency Gains
```
Current State:
- [Metric]: [Current performance]
- Cost of inefficiency: [$ or time]

Future State:
- [Metric]: [Target performance]
- Efficiency gain: [% improvement]

Business Impact:
- [Translate efficiency to $ or strategic outcome]

ROI:
- [Calculate return]
```

**Example:**
```
Current State:
- New rep ramp time: 120 days to quota
- Cost: 4 months × $10K/month salary + $0 revenue = $40K per rep

Future State:
- Ramp time: 60 days to quota (via structured onboarding)
- Cost: 2 months × $10K + accelerated revenue = $20K per rep

Business Impact:
- Hiring 12 reps/year
- Savings: 12 × $20K = $240K annually
- PLUS: 2 extra months of productivity per rep = $150K additional revenue

ROI:
- Investment: $80K (onboarding program)
- Total benefit: $390K (savings + revenue)
- Payback: 2.5 months
```

## Assumptions Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Always document assumptions in ROI calculations

### Template:
```markdown
## Assumptions

This ROI model is based on the following assumptions gathered during discovery:

1. **Team size:** [X reps]
2. **Avg hourly rate:** $[Y] (based on [source])
3. **Current time spent on [task]:** [Z hours/week] (per rep)
4. **Adoption rate:** [%] (based on [similar customer benchmark])
5. **Ramp time:** [Months to full adoption]
6. **Benchmark data:** [Source: Similar customer / Industry report]

### Sensitivity Analysis
| Assumption | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Time saved | [X hrs] | [Y hrs] | [Z hrs] |
| ROI | [Low %] | [Base %] | [High %] |
| Payback | [Long] | [Base] | [Short] |
```

**Why this matters:**
- Builds trust (transparent calculations)
- Allows prospect to adjust inputs
- Addresses "seems too good to be true" concerns
- CFO/finance teams demand this level of rigor

## Competitive Value Positioning

When competing against alternatives:

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Comparison

```markdown
## TCO Analysis: [Your Solution] vs. [Competitor]

| Cost Component | Competitor | Your Solution |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **Year 1 Costs** | | |
| Licensing | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Implementation | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Training | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Integrations | $[X] | $[Y] |
| **Subtotal** | **$[Total]** | **$[Total]** |
| | | |
| **Ongoing Costs (Annual)** | | |
| Subscription | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Maintenance | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Additional users | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Support | $[X] | $[Y] |
| **Subtotal** | **$[Total]** | **$[Total]** |
| | | |
| **Hidden Costs** | | |
| Manual workarounds | $[X] | $0 |
| Integration gaps | $[X] | $0 |
| Limited features | $[X] | $0 |
| **Subtotal** | **$[Total]** | **$0** |
| | | |
| **3-Year TCO** | **$[Higher]** | **$[Lower]** |
```

**Narrative:**
```
"While [Competitor] appears cheaper upfront ($X vs. $Y), the total cost over 3 years is actually higher due to:
1. [Hidden cost 1]: $[Amount]
2. [Hidden cost 2]: $[Amount]
3. [Hidden cost 3]: $[Amount]

Our customers report saving [%] vs. [Competitor] when factoring in [specific gaps/workarounds]."
```

---

## Objection Pre-emption

Build these into your value story to prevent objections:

**"Too expensive"**
→ Include payback period prominently (ideally <6 months)

**"Not sure it'll work for us"**
→ Reference 2-3 similar customers with before/after metrics

**"Too risky"**
→ Offer pilot/trial period with clear success criteria

**"Competitors are cheaper"**
→ Include TCO analysis showing total value

**"Takes too long to implement"**
→ Show phased rollout with quick wins in Phase 1

## Pro Tips

### Mirror Their Language
- Use their exact words for problems/outcomes from discovery
- Reference their internal metrics and KPIs
- Match their formality level (startup vs. enterprise)

### Anchor to Their Goals
- Tie value to company OKRs or annual initiatives
- Connect to executive's personal success metrics
- Reference board/investor expectations

### Make Assumptions Transparent
- Show your math
- Offer sensitivity ranges (conservative/base/optimistic)
- Invite them to adjust inputs

### Pair with Proof
- Every driver needs a customer story or benchmark
- Use logos/names when possible (with permission)
- Include before/after screenshots or metrics

### Keep Executive Version to 1 Page
- Detailed appendix for deep-dive
- One-pager for decision makers
- They don't have time for 20-page decks
