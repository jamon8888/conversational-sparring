# Value Propositions

## Quick Start

This skill helps you create ROI-driven value propositions. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Tools & Scripts

**ROI Calculator** (`scripts/roi_calculator.py`):

```bash
python scripts/roi_calculator.py --current_cost 100000 --time_saved 20 --hourly_rate 50
```

Calculates ROI for proposals.

## Execution Checklist

### Building a Value Prop

- [ ] Quantify current cost (time, money, opportunity)
- [ ] Calculate impact of solution
- [ ] Build ROI case (payback period, annual savings)
- [ ] Create before/after comparison
- [ ] Add social proof (similar companies)
- [ ] Present to economic buyer
- [ ] Address risk/objections

## Key Frameworks

- **ROI Formula**: (Gain - Cost) / Cost × 100
- **Payback Period**: Cost / Monthly Savings
- **Value Equation**: Dream Outcome + Likelihood - Time × Effort - Risk
- **Business Case**: Current State → Desired State → Solution → ROI

## Quick Wins

- Use customer's numbers (not yours)
- Show payback period <6 months
- Include non-financial benefits (time, stress)
- Provide 3 scenario options (conservative, realistic, optimistic)
