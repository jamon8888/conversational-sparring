# SPARK Framework for Cold Email

## Overview
SPARK is a proven framework for writing cold emails that get 10-15% reply rates (vs. 1-2% industry average).

## The SPARK Structure

### S - Subject Line
**Goal**: Get the email opened without triggering spam filters

**Formulas**:
```
"Quick question about [pain point]"
"[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
"Saw your post about [topic]"
"How [Similar Company] achieved [result]"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid spam words (FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW)
- Personalize when possible
- Create curiosity, not clickbait

### P - Problem
**Goal**: Show you understand their specific challenge

**Structure**:
```
"Noticed [Company] is [specific observation]."

"Most [job title]s I talk to struggle with [pain point]."
```

**Requirements**:
- Specific to their company/role
- Based on research (LinkedIn, company news, job postings)
- Relevant to your solution
- Empathetic, not accusatory

### A - Action (Research Proof)
**Goal**: Demonstrate you've done your homework

**Examples**:
```
"Saw you're hiring 5 SDRs this quarter..."
"Read your post about scaling outbound..."
"Noticed you recently launched [product]..."
"Congrats on the Series A..."
```

**Sources**:
- LinkedIn posts/activity
- Company blog
- Press releases
- Job postings
- Funding announcements
- Conference speaking

### R - Result
**Goal**: Show what's possible with social proof

**Structure**:
```
"We helped [Similar Company] achieve:
• [Specific metric 1]
• [Specific metric 2]
• [Specific metric 3]

in [timeframe]."
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use similar companies (size, industry, stage)
- Specific numbers (not "increased revenue")
- Realistic timeframes
- Relevant metrics

### K - Keep It Simple
**Goal**: Make it easy to respond

**Rules**:
- Under 100 words total
- 2-4 short paragraphs
- One clear question
- No attachments
- No links (except calendar)

**CTA Examples**:
```
"Worth a 15-min chat?"
"Should I send over the case study?"
"Open to exploring this?"
"Want to see how this works?"
```

## Complete Example

**Subject**: Quick question about SDR ramp time

**Body**:
```
Hi Sarah,

Noticed you're hiring 5 SDRs this quarter (congrats!).

Most VP Sales I talk to struggle with 90+ day ramp times. 
This usually means lost pipeline and frustrated reps.

We helped SalesLoft cut ramp time to 45 days using our 
training platform. They saw:
• 2x faster time-to-first-meeting
• 30% higher quota attainment
• 50% lower turnover

Worth a 15-min chat?

Mike
```

**Why This Works**:
- **S**: Specific subject (SDR ramp time)
- **P**: Clear problem (90+ day ramp)
- **A**: Research proof (hiring 5 SDRs)
- **R**: Social proof (SalesLoft results)
- **K**: 75 words, one question

## Personalization Levels

### Level 1: Basic (5 minutes)
- First name
- Company name
- Job title
- One research point (LinkedIn post, hiring, funding)

### Level 2: Standard (10 minutes)
- Level 1 +
- Specific pain point for their role
- Similar company reference
- Relevant trigger event

### Level 3: Deep (20 minutes)
- Level 2 +
- Multiple research points
- Custom ROI calculation
- Specific solution for their use case

**Recommendation**: Use Level 2 for most outreach. Reserve Level 3 for high-value accounts.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too long**: Over 150 words
✅ **Concise**: Under 100 words

❌ **About you**: "We're a leading platform..."
✅ **About them**: "Saw you're struggling with..."

❌ **Multiple CTAs**: "Want to chat? Or see a demo? Or read our case study?"
✅ **One CTA**: "Worth a 15-min chat?"

❌ **Generic**: "Hope this email finds you well"
✅ **Specific**: "Saw your post about scaling outbound"

❌ **Attachments**: PDF, deck, one-pager
✅ **Clean**: No attachments on first email

## Follow-up Sequence

**Email 1 (Day 0)**: SPARK email
**Email 2 (Day 3)**: Value add (article, case study)
**Email 3 (Day 7)**: Different angle (new pain point)
**Email 4 (Day 14)**: Breakup email ("Should I close your file?")

## Success Metrics

**Target Benchmarks**:
- Open rate: 40-60%
- Reply rate: 10-15%
- Positive reply rate: 5-8%
- Meeting booked rate: 3-5%

**If below targets**:
- Open rate low → Fix subject line
- Reply rate low → Improve personalization
- Positive replies low → Better value proposition
- Meetings low → Stronger CTA

## A/B Testing

**Test Variables**:
1. Subject line (curiosity vs. benefit)
2. Problem statement (specific vs. general)
3. Social proof (metrics vs. testimonial)
4. CTA (question vs. statement)

**Process**:
- Send 50 emails per variant
- Wait 5 business days
- Analyze reply rates
- Use winner for next batch
