**Focus**: Celebrate the transition from following a framework to intuitive decision-making.

- **Tactic**: Highlight when the user identifies a "Scope Creep" themselves. "SDT: Autonomy achieved."

### Dual-Mode Context

- **Team Mode**: Celebrate the growth in prioritization discipline.

- **Adoption**: "100 users tried the new feature today!"
- **Learning**: "The experiment failed, but we learned X. That's a win."
- **Focus**: "You killed a zombie feature. That takes courage."
