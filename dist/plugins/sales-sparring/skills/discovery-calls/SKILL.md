# Discovery Calls

## Quick Start

This skill helps you prepare for and run effective discovery calls. For complete frameworks and question banks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Preparing for Discovery

- [ ] Research prospect (company, role, recent activity)
- [ ] Review previous interactions (emails, social engagement)
- [ ] Prepare SPIN questions (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff)
- [ ] Set call agenda (share ahead of time)
- [ ] Prepare qualification criteria (BANT or MEDDICC)
- [ ] Set up screen sharing/demo (if needed)

### Running the Call

- [ ] Start with rapport building (2-3 min)
- [ ] Set agenda and timeline (30-45 min call)
- [ ] Ask Situation questions (understand current state)
- [ ] Ask Problem questions (identify pain points)
- [ ] Ask Implication questions (explore consequences)
- [ ] Ask Need-Payoff questions (envision solution impact)
- [ ] Qualify using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
- [ ] Summarize next steps
- [ ] Schedule follow-up

## Key Frameworks

- **SPIN**: Situation → Problem → Implication → Need-Payoff
- **BANT**: Budget + Authority + Need + Timeline (all must be "yes")
- **MEDDICC**: Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, Champion, Competition
- **Talk Ratio**: 70% prospect, 30% you

## Quick Wins

- Send agenda 24 hours before call
- Start with open-ended questions ("Tell me about...")
- Listen more than talk (70/30 rule)
- Take notes visibly (shows you care)
- End with clear next step and timeline
