# Discovery Calls Mastery

## Overview
Structure and execute discovery calls that uncover pain, timeline, authority, and budget. This skill helps you prepare for, run, and follow up on first sales conversations with qualified prospects.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- New prospects booked from outbound or inbound
- First-time sales conversations
- Qualifying opportunities
- Multi-threaded enterprise deals
- Understanding buyer landscape

---

## Core Framework: PREP

Before every discovery call, complete this preparation:

### **P** - Purpose
Define what you need to learn from this call:
- Is this a fit for our ICP?
- What's their urgency and budget?
- Who else needs to be involved?
- What's the next step if qualified?

### **R** - Research
Gather intelligence before the call:
- Company: Size, industry, funding, recent news
- Person: Role, tenure, LinkedIn activity, past experience
- Context: How they found you, what content they engaged with
- Tech stack: What tools they currently use

### **E** - Evidence
Prepare relevant proof points:
- Similar customer stories (same industry/size/persona)
- Relevant metrics or benchmarks
- Case studies or testimonials
- Product capabilities that match their likely needs

### **P** - Plan
Structure your call flow (see below) and prepare:
- Opening agenda statement
- Core questions to ask
- Next step options
- Calendar links ready to schedule

## Discovery Call Flow

### Time Allocation (30-minute call)
- **2 min:** Rapport & agenda
- **3 min:** Get context
- **8 min:** Uncover pain & impact
- **4 min:** Explore vision & decision process
- **3 min:** Confirm next steps & schedule

---

## Call Script Structure

### Opening (2 min)
```
"Hi [Name], great to finally connect! I have us down for 30 minutes—does that still work?

Here's what I thought we'd cover:
1. Learn about your current [process/challenge]
2. Share what we've seen work for [similar companies]
3. Figure out if there's a fit and what makes sense as a next step

Sound good? Great—before I ask a bunch of questions, what prompted you to take this call?"
```

**Why this works:**
- Confirms time (shows respect)
- Sets clear expectations
- Transitions to discovery mode
- Opens with their perspective

---

### Getting Context (3 min)
```
"Tell me about your current process for [X]. Walk me through what that looks like day-to-day."

Follow-ups:
- "Who's involved in that process?"
- "What tools are you using today?"
- "How long have you been doing it this way?"
```

**What you're listening for:**
- Current state & workflow
- Team structure & ownership
- Existing tech stack
- Tenure (how long they've had the problem)

---

### Uncovering Pain & Impact (8 min - MOST IMPORTANT)
```
"You mentioned [their process]. What's the biggest challenge or bottleneck you're facing with that?"

Pain questions:
- "What have you tried to fix this in the past? Why didn't it work?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"

Impact questions:
- "How much time does your team spend on this each week?"
- "What's this costing you—in time, money, or missed opportunities?"
- "How does this problem ripple to other parts of the business?"
```

**What you're listening for:**
- Specific pain points (not generic problems)
- Quantified impact (hours, dollars, opportunities)
- Urgency signals
- Emotional language ("frustrating," "brutal," "killing us")

---

### Vision & Decision Process (4 min)
```
Vision:
- "If we solve this, what does success look like 6-12 months from now?"
- "How are you measuring success on this initiative?"
- "What would make you look like a hero internally?"

Decision process:
- "Walk me through how you typically evaluate and buy tools like this."
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "Is there budget allocated, or do we need to build a business case?"
- "What's your timeline for getting something in place?"
```

**What you're listening for:**
- Stakeholders (economic buyer, technical buyer, champion)
- Budget status & approval process
- Timeline & urgency
- Decision criteria
- Competition (who else are they talking to?)

---

### Confirm Next Steps (3 min)
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [summarize pain + impact + urgency].

Here's what I think makes sense as a next step: [demo / deeper dive / technical review / business case].

I have [day/time] or [day/time] open. Which works better for you?"

[Book meeting live on the call]

"Perfect. I'll send a recap email in the next hour with:
- Summary of what we discussed
- [Relevant case study / resource]
- Calendar invite for our [next meeting type]

Sound good?"
```

**Why this works:**
- Demonstrates you listened (summary)
- Proposes clear next step
- Creates urgency (book now)
- Sets expectation for follow-up

## Question Bank by Buyer Persona

### Executive / Economic Buyer
**Focus:** Strategic alignment, ROI, risk mitigation

- "Who else cares about solving this, and how are they measuring success?"
- "How will you evaluate whether this investment was successful 12 months from now?"
- "Is there budget allocated for this, or do we need to build a business case together?"
- "What's the cost of the status quo—in revenue, efficiency, or risk?"

---

### Champion / Project Lead
**Focus:** Workflow, implementation, personal win

**Questions:**

---

### End User / Practitioner

**Questions:**

- "What would make this tool a must-have vs. nice-to-have for you?"
- "How tech-savvy is your team? What's their comfort level with new tools?"
- "What tools do you love using today? What makes them great?"
- "How much time do you spend on [manual task] each week?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Talking too much**
- Problem: Spending 20+ minutes pitching
- Fix: 80% listening, 20% talking

**Leading with product**
- Problem: Showing demo before understanding needs
- Fix: Discovery first, demo second

**Not confirming next steps**
- Problem: "We'll follow up soon"
- Fix: Book next meeting live on the call

**Skipping qualification**
- Problem: Advancing unqualified leads
- Fix: Use MEDDICC/BANT scorecard every time

**Not taking notes**
- Problem: Forgetting key details
- Fix: Use note template, update CRM same day

**Accepting vague answers**
- Problem: "Budget isn't an issue" or "We'll figure it out"
- Fix: Ask clarifying questions until you get specifics

## Pro Tips

### Build Rapport Fast
- Reference their LinkedIn activity
- Mirror their communication style (formal vs. casual)
- Use their exact language for problems/solutions
- Find common ground (alma mater, mutual connections, industry trends)

### Control the Call
- Start with clear agenda
- Time-box each section
- Redirect politely if they go off track: "That's interesting—let's come back to that. First, I want to understand..."
- End 2-3 min early to build in buffer

### Qualify Without Offending
- Frame budget questions as: "To make sure I'm not wasting your time, what's the typical range for projects like this?"
- Frame authority questions as: "Who else should I be talking to so we're all aligned?"
- Frame timing questions as: "What's driving the urgency on this?"

### Multi-Threading
- Always ask: "Who else should be involved in this conversation?"
- Get intros to economic buyer, technical buyer, and end users
- Avoid single-threaded deals (one contact = high risk)

### Tag Recordings
If you record calls, add chapter markers:
- 00:00 - Intro
- 02:30 - Current state
- 06:00 - **PAIN POINT** (most important)
- 14:00 - Decision process
- 20:00 - Next steps

This lets AEs/managers jump straight to key moments.
