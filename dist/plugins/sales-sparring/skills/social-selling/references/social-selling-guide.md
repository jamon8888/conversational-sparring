## When to Use This Skill

## Core Principles

### 1. **Insight First**
Don't lead with pitch—lead with value
- Comment thoughtfully on their posts
- Share relevant resources
- Provide genuine insights

### 2. **Timely Engagement**
Strike while the iron is hot
- Engage within 30 minutes of their activity
- Reference current events (job change, funding, launch)
- Ride momentum of recent posts/discussions

### 3. **Sequence Public + Private Touches**
Mix visibility with direct outreach
- Public: Comments, likes, shares (builds credibility)
- Private: DMs, connection requests (drives conversion)
- Balance to avoid feeling pushy

### 4. **Lead with Social Proof**
Leverage credibility signals
- Mutual connections
- Customer logos in your profile
- Shared experiences (alumni, conferences, communities)
- Thought leadership content

### 5. **Call-to-Value Offers**
Make it about them, not you
- "Thought you'd find this useful..."
- "Saw your post about X—here's what worked for us..."
- "Happy to intro you to [valuable connection]"

## Framework: The Engagement Ladder

Move prospects up the ladder over time:

- Set Google Alerts for company news
- Monitor hashtags/keywords relevant to their pain

**Tools:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Google Alerts

### Step 2: **Micro-Engage**
Build familiarity through small interactions

- Tag them when relevant

**Frequency:** 1-2 times per week per target

### Step 3: **Value Drops**
Comment with genuine insights

**Examples:**
```
"Love this take, [Name]. We saw the same pattern with our customers—37% said [insight]. Have you found [related question]?"

"Totally agree on [point]. One thing we've seen work is [specific tactic]. Worth trying if you haven't already!"

"This is spot-on. [Customer] struggled with this exact issue and solved it by [approach]. Happy to intro if helpful!"
```

**Frequency:** 1 comment per week on high-value posts

---

### Step 4: **DM / Connection Request**
Transition from public to private

- **Company funding:** Growth mode, likely hiring & buying
- **Product launch:** Need support tools, integrations
- **Hiring posts:** Scaling pain points
- **Problem posts:** "Anyone know how to [X]?" = high intent
- **Competitor mentions:** Evaluating alternatives

### Medium-Value Signals (Engage Within 24 Hours)
- **Content engagement:** Liked/commented on your post or company content
- **Webinar attendance:** Showed interest in topic
- **Profile views:** Checked you out (LinkedIn premium)
- **Mutual connection:** Someone you both know
- **Industry event:** Attending same conference

### Low-Value Signals (Passive Monitoring)
- **General thought leadership:** Posting about industry trends (not buying signals)
- **Personal milestones:** Work anniversary, birthday (engage for relationship building, not sales)
