# Follow-Up Sequences Mastery

## Overview
Plan and execute multi-touch cadences that nurture cold prospects and re-engage stalled deals. This skill helps you design persistent, value-driven follow-up strategies across email, LinkedIn, and phone.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Prospects haven't responded to initial outreach
- Nurturing cold leads over time
- Re-engaging stalled opportunities
- Multi-touch campaigns for target accounts
- Following up after demos or proposals

---

## Core Principle: Persistence + Value

**The Challenge:**
- 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups
- Most reps give up after 2 touchpoints
- You need to be persistent without being annoying

**The Solution:**
- Each touch adds NEW value (not "just checking in")
- Mix channels (email + LinkedIn + phone)
- Use strategic timing (3-7-14 day intervals)
- End with a clear "breakup" to create urgency

---

## Framework: The 3-7-14 Cadence

Standard multi-touch sequence over 2 weeks:

| Day | Channel | Goal | Type |
|-----|---------|------|------|
| 0 | Email | Initial outreach | SPARK-formatted cold email |
| 3 | LinkedIn | Stay visible | Like/comment on their post |
| 5 | Email | Provide value | Share resource, case study |
| 7 | Phone | Direct ask | Leave personalized voicemail |
| 10 | LinkedIn | Different angle | DM with new pain point |
| 12 | Email | Create urgency | "Last attempt" tone |
| 14 | Email | Breakup | "Should I close your file?" |

**After Day 14:**
- No response → Long-term nurture (monthly touches)
- Positive response → Move to discovery call
- Objection → Use objection handling framework

---

## Email Sequence Templates

### Touch 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)
Use SPARK framework from Cold Outreach skill

```
Subject: Quick question about [initiative]

[Name],

[Personalized observation]

[Problem statement]

We helped [Customer] solve this by [solution]. They saw [metric] in [timeframe].

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 2: Value-Add (Day 5)
Provide resource WITHOUT asking for anything

```
Subject: Thought this might be useful

[Name],

Following up on my note from [day of week].

Regardless of whether we work together, I thought this might be helpful: [resource link]

It's a [case study / guide / template] showing how [similar company] [achieved outcome].

Hope it's useful!

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- No ask = no pressure
- Builds goodwill
- Keeps you top of mind
- Often triggers reply

---

### Touch 3: Different Angle (Day 10)
Approach from new pain point

```
Subject: Different thought

[Name],

Realized I may have led with the wrong angle in my last email.

Most [personas] we talk to don't care about [original pain point]—they're more focused on [new pain point].

Is [new angle] more relevant for you right now?

If not, no worries—I'll stop bothering you!

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges you might have missed the mark
- Shows you've thought about their needs
- Gives them an easy out ("no worries")

---

### Touch 4: Last Attempt (Day 12)
Create mild urgency

```
Subject: Last attempt

[Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing one of three things:

1. You're interested but buried (I get it)
2. Wrong timing (fair enough)
3. Not a fit (totally cool)

If it's #1, happy to reconnect—just reply "Yes" and I'll send calendar options.

If it's #2 or #3, no hard feelings. I'll close your file unless I hear otherwise.

Thanks for your time!

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Addresses the elephant in the room
- Makes it easy to respond (one word: "Yes")
- Creates urgency without being pushy

---

### Touch 5: Breakup Email (Day 14)
Give permission to say no

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[Name],

I've reached out a few times about [topic] but haven't heard back.

I don't want to be that annoying salesperson who won't take a hint, so I'm going to assume this isn't a priority right now.

If that changes, just reply "Reopen" and I'll reconnect.

Otherwise, I'll close your file.

Thanks for your time!

[Your name]

P.S. — If timing just isn't right, when should I check back in? Q3? Q4?
```

**Why this works:**
- Respectful of their time
- Creates scarcity ("last chance")
- P.S. offers alternative (timing objection)
- Often triggers response ("Don't close my file!")

**Response rate:** 10-30% reply to breakup emails

## LinkedIn Sequence

### Touch 1: Connection Request (Day 1)
```
Hi [Name]—saw your post about [topic]. We help [persona] at [company type] solve [problem]. Worth connecting to exchange ideas?
```

---

### Touch 2: Post-Accept Message (Day 4)
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

[Personalized observation about their profile/company]

We recently helped [Customer] achieve [metric] by [approach].

Open to a quick call to see if there's a fit?

```

---

### Touch 3: Engage with Content (Day 7)
Like/comment on their recent post (don't DM)

**Comment example:**
```
Great point on [topic], [Name]. We've seen the same pattern with [industry] companies. [Customer] solved this by [approach]—happy to share what worked if it's relevant!
```

---

### Touch 4: DM with Different Angle (Day 11)
```
Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my last message.

I realized I led with [original angle], but based on your recent post about [topic], it sounds like [new angle] might be more pressing.

[Customer] was in the same spot and solved it by [approach]. Saw [metric] in [timeframe].

Worth a 15-minute call to explore?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 5: Final LinkedIn Touch (Day 15)
```
Hi [Name],

Last note from me—don't want to spam your inbox!

If [problem] becomes a priority, just ping me and we'll reconnect.

Otherwise, best of luck with [initiative you saw on their profile]!

[Your name]

## Phone Voicemail Scripts

### Voicemail 1: After Email (Day 7)
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I sent you an email earlier this week about [topic].

Quick context: We help [persona] at companies like [Customer] achieve [outcome]. Thought it might be relevant for you.

I'll shoot you another email with a case study, but if you want to chat sooner, my number is [XXX-XXX-XXXX].

Thanks!"
```

**Length:** 20-30 seconds max

---

### Voicemail 2: Last Attempt (Day 13)
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Company] again.

I've tried reaching you a few times about [topic]. I don't want to be a pest, so this will be my last call unless I hear from you.

If timing's just off, no problem—shoot me an email when things settle down.

My number is [XXX-XXX-XXXX].

Thanks, and good luck with [initiative]!"
```

## Multi-Channel Coordination

**DON'T:** Email, call, and LinkedIn DM on the same day
**DO:** Space touches across channels strategically

| 7 | Call + voicemail | — |
| 9 | — | LinkedIn: Comment on post |
| 10 | Email #3 (different angle) | — |
| 12 | Email #4 (last attempt) | — |
| 13 | — | Call + voicemail #2 |
| 14 | Email #5 (breakup) | LinkedIn DM (final) |

**Total touches:** 11 over 14 days
**Channels:** 5 email, 4 LinkedIn, 2 phone

### Monthly Touch Cadence

- **Month 2:** Send customer success story
- **Month 3:** Invite to webinar or event
- **Month 4:** Product update or new feature
- **Month 5:** Re-engagement: "Wanted to reconnect..."

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Relevant topic]

[Name],

Hope you're doing well! Haven't connected in a while.

Thought you might find this interesting: [resource / insight / customer story]

[One-sentence relevance to their situation]

If [problem] is still on your radar, let's reconnect. Otherwise, I'll keep you on my quarterly update list.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Timing Best Practices

### Best Days to Send
- **Tue-Thu:** Highest open/reply rates
- **Mon:** Often buried in weekend backlog
- **Fri:** People in weekend mode

### Best Times to Send
- **8-10 AM local time:** Inbox zero mode
- **12-1 PM:** Lunch check
- **4-5 PM:** End-of-day wind-down

**Avoid:**
- Early morning Mon (<9 AM)
- Late Fri (>3 PM)
- Weekends (unless industry-specific)

---

## Success Metrics

### Email Metrics
- **Open rate:** Target 30-40%
- **Reply rate:** Target 8-15%
- **Breakup email reply rate:** Target 10-30%

### Multi-Channel Metrics
- **Response rate (any channel):** Target 20-30%
- **Meeting booked rate:** Target 3-5%
- **Touches to conversion:** Average 5-7

### Channel Effectiveness
Track which channel drives best response:
- Email: 40-50% of replies
- LinkedIn: 30-40% of replies
- Phone: 10-20% of replies

## Personalization Tokens

Make follow-ups feel custom (even if templated):

**Use:**
- {{first_name}}
- {{company}}
- {{industry}}
- {{pain_point}} (from discovery/research)
- {{recent_trigger}} (job change, funding, post topic)
- {{mutual_connection}}
- {{customer_similar_to_them}}

**Example:**
```
"Hi {{first_name}},

Saw {{company}} just raised ${{funding_amount}}. Congrats!

Most {{industry}} companies we work with face {{pain_point}} when scaling. We helped {{customer_similar_to_them}} solve this by..."
```

---

## Automation Tips

**DO Automate:**
- Sequence timing (Day 3, 7, 14)
- Follow-up reminders
- Task creation (call on Day 7)
- CRM logging

**DON'T Automate:**
- Personalization (research their trigger)
- First line of email (custom every time)
- LinkedIn messages (LinkedIn detects bots)
- Voicemails (always record live)

**Tools:**
- **Email:** Outreach, SalesLoft, HubSpot Sequences
- **LinkedIn:** SalesNavigator (manual), Phantombuster (risky)
- **Phone:** Aircall, Dialpad (click-to-dial)
