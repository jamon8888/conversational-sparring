---

## When to Use This Skill

- Building outbound sequences for new prospects
- Personalizing cold email or LinkedIn outreach
- Diagnosing low open or reply rates
- Designing follow-up cadences
- Founder-led sales or SDR outreach

---

## Core Framework: SPARK

Every effective cold outreach message follows this structure:

### **S** - Subject Hook
- 3-6 words maximum
- Creates curiosity or states clear value
- Personalized when possible

**Examples:**
- "Quick question about [initiative]"
- "Noticed you're hiring [role]"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Idea for [specific goal]"

### **P** - Personalized Opening
- Reference a specific trigger (funding, hiring, post, event)
- Show you've done research
- Make it relevant to THEM, not you

**Examples:**
- "Saw you just raised Series B—congrats!"
- "Noticed you're hiring 3 SDRs. Scaling fast?"
- "Your post about [topic] resonated—we see the same challenge"

### **A** - Agitate Problem
- Highlight a pain point they likely face
- Keep it specific to their situation
- One sentence maximum

**Examples:**
- "Most VPs we talk to struggle to keep pipeline full when scaling this fast"
- "Ramping new reps typically takes 90 days—brutal when you need results now"

### **R** - Relevant Value
- State your solution in ONE sentence
- Include social proof (customer name, metric)
- Make the outcome concrete

**Examples:**
- "We helped [similar company] cut ramp time to 30 days with our playbook system"
- "Our customers close 3x more deals by automating research + personalization"

### **K** - Keep-it-Simple CTA
- Single, low-friction ask
- Make it easy to say yes
- Suggest a specific next step

**Examples:**
- "Worth a 15-minute call to explore?"
- "Can I send you a 2-minute case study?"
- "Open to a quick screen share next week?"

Sarah,

Saw you're hiring 3 SDRs on LinkedIn. Congrats on the growth!

Still interested in exploring how [similar company] achieved [result]?

[Your name]

## Best Practices

### Personalization Triggers
Look for these signals to personalize your outreach:
- **Funding announcements** → "Congrats on Series B..."
- **Executive hires** → "Saw you brought on a new CRO..."
- **Product launches** → "Noticed you launched [product]..."
- **Job changes** → "Congrats on the new role..."
- **LinkedIn posts** → "Your post about [topic] resonated..."
- **Company growth** → "Saw you're hiring [number] [roles]..."
- **Tech stack changes** → "Noticed you just implemented [tool]..."

### Mobile-First Formatting
- Keep lines under 60 characters
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Add white space for readability
- Single CTA only

### Subject Line Formulas
- **Question format:** "Quick question about [initiative]?"
- **Observation:** "Noticed [specific thing]"
- **Value statement:** "Idea for [their goal]"
- **Mutual connection:** "[Name] suggested we connect"
- **Trigger event:** "Congrats on [achievement]"
- **Resource offer:** "[Resource type] for [their goal]"

### What NOT to Do
- Multiple asks or CTAs
- Long paragraphs (>3 lines)
- Generic "spray and pray" templates
- Talking about yourself/your company
- Vague value propositions
- Attachments in first email
- Multiple follow-ups in one day

### What TO Do
- Lead with their context, not yours
- One specific, quantified outcome
- Social proof (customer names + metrics)
- Make the ask crystal clear
- Offer value before requesting time
- Test and iterate based on reply rates

## Channel Mix Strategy

Don't rely on email alone. Coordinate across channels:

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: LinkedIn connection request
- Day 2: Cold email (after connection accepted)
- Day 4: LinkedIn comment on their post

**Week 2:**
- Day 7: Email follow-up with resource
- Day 9: LinkedIn DM with different angle

**Week 3:**
- Day 14: Breakup email
- Day 15: Final LinkedIn touch

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to optimize your outreach:

- **Open rate:** Target ≥30%
- **Reply rate:** Target ≥10%
- **Positive reply rate:** Target ≥5%
- **Meeting booked rate:** Target ≥2-3%

If you're below these benchmarks:
- Low opens → Test subject lines
- Low replies → Improve personalization + value prop
- Low positive replies → Refine ICP targeting

---

## A/B Testing Ideas

Test one variable at a time:
- Subject line length (short vs. question format)
- Opening line (trigger vs. mutual connection)
- Value prop (feature vs. outcome)
- CTA (call vs. resource vs. question)
- Send time (morning vs. afternoon)
- Day of week (Tue-Thu typically best)
