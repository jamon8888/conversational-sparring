# Growth Analytics

## Quick Start

This skill helps you track growth metrics. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building Growth Dashboard

- [ ] Define North Star Metric
- [ ] Map funnel stages (AARRR)
- [ ] Set up event tracking
- [ ] Build cohort analysis
- [ ] Track activation rate
- [ ] Monitor retention curves
- [ ] Calculate LTV and CAC
- [ ] Review weekly

## Key Metrics (AARRR)

- **Acquisition**: New signups, CAC
- **Activation**: % reaching "aha moment"
- **Revenue**: LTV, ARPU, conversion rate
- **Retention**: D1, D7, D30 retention
- **Referral**: K-factor, viral coefficient

## Quick Wins

- North Star Metric dashboard
- Weekly cohort retention reports
- Activation funnel analysis
- CAC payback period tracking
