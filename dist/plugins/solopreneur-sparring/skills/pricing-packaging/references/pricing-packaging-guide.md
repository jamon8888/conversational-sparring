# Pricing & Packaging: Strategic Revenue Optimization

## Overview

Pricing and packaging is the art and science of structuring your product offerings and determining what customers pay. For solo entrepreneurs and small teams, pricing decisions have the single largest impact on revenue—more than marketing, sales, or product improvements. A 1% price increase can improve profits by 10-20%, yet most companies undercharge and leave massive revenue on the table.

**When to use this skill:**
- You're launching a new product and need to set initial pricing
- Revenue is growing but profits aren't (pricing too low)
- Customers say "yes" too quickly without negotiation (underpriced)
- High churn suggests customers don't see value (price-value misalignment)
- You have one pricing tier and need to capture more value (add tiers)
- Competitors are undercutting you or you need to justify premium pricing
- You're preparing for fundraising and need defensible unit economics
- Sales reps complain about "losing deals on price"

**Why pricing and packaging matter:**
- **Profit leverage:** Pricing has 3-5x more impact on profit than volume or cost reduction
- **Customer segmentation:** Good packaging captures value from different buyer segments
- **Positioning:** Premium pricing signals quality and value
- **Revenue predictability:** Right pricing model creates stable, recurring revenue
- **Sales efficiency:** Clear packaging makes selling easier and faster
- **Expansion revenue:** Multi-tier packaging enables upsells and expansion

**The cost of poor pricing:**
- **Underpricing:** Leaving 20-40% of revenue on the table
- **Single-tier pricing:** Forcing SMB and Enterprise into same plan (losing both)
- **Vague packaging:** Confusing customers, slowing sales cycles
- **No expansion path:** Customers max out at entry price, no upsell opportunity
- **Price-value disconnect:** High churn because customers don't see ROI

## The Pricing & Packaging Framework

### 1. Value-Based Pricing Fundamentals

**Pricing Philosophy: Charge Based on Value, Not Cost**

```
COST-PLUS PRICING (❌ Avoid):
Price = Cost + Desired Margin

Example:
Product costs $20/month to deliver (servers, support)
Desired margin: 80%
Price = $20 / (1 - 0.80) = $100/month

WHY THIS FAILS:
- Ignores customer willingness to pay
- Leaves money on table if value > cost
- Creates race to the bottom (competitors cut costs)

VALUE-BASED PRICING (✓ Use):
Price = Customer's Willingness to Pay (based on value delivered)

Example:
Your tool saves customer 20 hours/month
Customer values time at $100/hour
Value delivered = $2,000/month
Price = 10-20% of value = $200-$400/month

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Captures fair share of value created
- Justifies premium pricing
- Aligns incentives (more value = higher price)
- Creates space for profit and reinvestment
```

**The Value Equation**

```
Customer's Willingness to Pay is determined by:

VALUE CREATED:
+ Time saved (hours × hourly rate)
+ Revenue increased (new sales, higher close rates)
+ Cost reduced (eliminated tools, reduced headcount)
+ Risk mitigated (compliance, security, downtime prevention)

MINUS ALTERNATIVES:
- Cost of status quo (DIY, manual processes)
- Cost of competitor solutions
- Switching costs (migration, training, opportunity cost)

PRICING SWEET SPOT:
Price should be 10-30% of value delivered

TOO LOW (<10% of value): Leaving money on table, signaling low quality
JUST RIGHT (10-30%): Fair value exchange, sustainable
TOO HIGH (>30%): Hard to justify ROI, high churn risk

EXAMPLE:
SaaS tool for sales teams

VALUE CREATED:
- Saves 10 hours/week per rep (40 hours/month)
- Rep costs $75/hour fully loaded
- Value: 40 hours × $75 = $3,000/month per rep

- Increases close rate by 10% (from 20% → 22%)
- Average deal size: $25,000
- Rep closes 2 deals/month normally = $50K
- 10% increase = +$5,000/month in revenue
- Assuming 30% attributed to tool = +$1,500/month

Total Value: $3,000 + $1,500 = $4,500/month per rep

PRICING TARGET:
10-30% of value = $450-$1,350/month per rep
Charge: $500/month per rep (11% of value, easy ROI case)

5-rep team = $2,500/month
10-rep team = $5,000/month
```

### 2. Pricing Models

**Per-Seat Pricing**
```
STRUCTURE:
$X per user per month

EXAMPLE:
- $50/user/month
- 10 users = $500/month
- Add 5 users = $750/month

PROS:
✓ Simple to understand and calculate
✓ Revenue scales with customer team growth
✓ Easy to implement and track
✓ Industry standard (familiar to buyers)

CONS:
✗ Can discourage adoption (pay more to add users)
✗ Doesn't capture value if power users vs. light users
✗ Seat-sharing or fake accounts to avoid costs

BEST FOR:
- Collaboration tools (Slack, Asana)
- Design tools (Figma, Canva)
- CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Tools where each person gets clear value

OPTIMIZATION:
- Offer volume discounts (11-25 seats: 10% off)
- Introduce "viewer" or "limited" seats (lower price)
- Cap seats for Enterprise (unlimited users for $10K/month)
```

**Usage-Based Pricing**
```
STRUCTURE:
$X per [unit of usage]

EXAMPLE:
- $0.01 per email sent
- $5 per 1,000 API calls
- $100 per GB of storage

PROS:
✓ Aligns price with value (pay for what you use)
✓ Low friction for new customers (small initial cost)
✓ Automatic expansion revenue (usage grows over time)
✓ Fair for light vs. heavy users

CONS:
✗ Unpredictable costs for customers (budgeting difficulty)
✗ Revenue unpredictability for you
✗ Complex to implement (metering, billing)
✗ Customers may optimize to reduce usage (bad for you)

BEST FOR:
- API platforms (Stripe, Twilio, AWS)
- Email marketing (Mailchimp, SendGrid)
- Data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks)
- Infrastructure (hosting, CDN)

OPTIMIZATION:
- Add minimum commitment (e.g., $100/month minimum)
- Offer prepaid credits (buy $1,000 upfront, get 10% bonus)
- Tier pricing (first 10K emails: $0.10, next 10K: $0.08)
```

**Tiered Pricing (Good-Better-Best)**
```
STRUCTURE:
3-4 pricing tiers with increasing features and price

EXAMPLE:
Starter: $49/month (basic features)
Professional: $199/month (advanced features)
Enterprise: $999/month (full features + support)

PROS:
✓ Captures value from different customer segments
✓ Creates clear upgrade path (expansion revenue)
✓ Anchoring effect (middle tier looks like best value)
✓ Segmentation (SMB → Starter, Enterprise → Enterprise)

CONS:
✗ Can be confusing if too many tiers
✗ Risk of customers "downgrading" to lower tier
✗ Feature set decisions are critical (what goes where?)

BEST FOR:
- SaaS products with varied customer base
- Products with clear feature progression
- When serving SMB, Mid-Market, and Enterprise

OPTIMIZATION (see section below for details):
- 3-4 tiers maximum (more = paradox of choice)
- Price jumps: 2-3x between tiers ($49 → $149 → $449)
- Middle tier = 60% of customers (optimize for this)
- Anchor with highest tier (makes middle look like deal)
```

**Freemium**
```
STRUCTURE:
Free tier + Paid tiers

EXAMPLE:
Free: $0 (limited features, 10 users max)
Starter: $49/month (more features, 50 users)
Pro: $199/month (advanced features, unlimited users)

PROS:
✓ Zero-friction acquisition (viral growth)
✓ Try before you buy (reduces risk)
✓ Network effects (free users invite others)
✓ Large user base for upsell funnel

CONS:
✗ Low conversion rates (2-5% free → paid typical)
✗ High support costs for free users
✗ Difficult to balance free vs. paid value
✗ Requires scale to be profitable

BEST FOR:
- Product-led growth (PLG) companies
- Network-effect products (social, collaboration)
- Products with low marginal cost (SaaS, not services)
- When you need large user base fast

OPTIMIZATION:
- Limit free tier by usage, time, or features (not all three)
- Clear upgrade prompts when hitting limits
- Email nurture to convert free → paid
- Monetize power users, not casual users
```

**Flat-Rate Pricing**
```
STRUCTURE:
One price, all features included

EXAMPLE:
$299/month for unlimited users, all features

PROS:
✓ Simplest to understand (no confusion)
✓ Easy to sell (no feature comparison)
✓ Predictable revenue and costs
✓ Customers love simplicity

CONS:
✗ Leaves money on table (power users underpay)
✗ No expansion revenue path (maxed out at entry)
✗ Difficult to serve wide range of company sizes
✗ Hard to justify price increases over time

BEST FOR:
- Niche products with homogeneous customers
- Early-stage products (test willingness to pay)
- Simple products with few features
- When you want to compete on simplicity

OPTIMIZATION:
- Consider tiering by customer size (SMB: $299, Enterprise: $999)
- Add-on modules for expansion (base: $299, +analytics: $99)
- Annual vs. monthly pricing (annual = discount)
```

### 3. Building a Good-Better-Best Pricing Structure

**The 3-Tier Framework**

```
TIER 1: STARTER / BASIC / ESSENTIAL
Target: Small businesses, startups, solopreneurs
Price: $49-$99/month
Features: Core functionality, limited usage, self-service support

TIER 2: PROFESSIONAL / BUSINESS / PREMIUM
Target: Growing companies, SMB, mid-market (60% of customers should choose this)
Price: 2.5-3x Tier 1 ($149-$299/month)
Features: Advanced features, higher limits, email/chat support

TIER 3: ENTERPRISE / UNLIMITED / ADVANCED
Target: Large companies, enterprises (acts as anchor to make Tier 2 look good)
Price: 4-5x Tier 1 ($449-$999/month or custom)
Features: Everything, unlimited usage, dedicated support, SLAs, SSO, custom integrations

OPTIONAL TIER 4: CUSTOM / STRATEGIC
Target: Very large enterprises (typically custom pricing)
Price: $5,000-$50,000+/month
Features: White-glove service, custom development, dedicated CSM, premium SLAs
```

**Feature Allocation Strategy**

```

- Team collaboration (no → yes → advanced)

LIMIT BY SUPPORT/SERVICE:
- Support: Email only → Email + chat → Email + chat + phone → Dedicated CSM
- Response time: 48 hours → 24 hours → 4 hours → 1 hour
- Training: Self-service → Onboarding call → White-glove → Dedicated training
```

```

### 4. Pricing Psychology and Tactics

**Anchoring Effect**
```
PRINCIPLE:
First price seen becomes "anchor" - all other prices judged relative to it

TACTIC:
Show highest tier first (or on left) to anchor high

EXAMPLE:
❌ WRONG ORDER:
Starter $49 | Pro $199 | Enterprise $699

✓ RIGHT ORDER (on website):
Enterprise $699 | Pro $199 | Starter $49

Or use "Most Popular" badge to anchor on middle tier

IMPACT:
When $699 is shown first, $199 looks like a bargain
When $49 is shown first, $199 looks expensive
```

**Decoy Pricing**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Add a "decoy" option that makes target option look better

EXAMPLE:
Starter: $49/month (5 users)
Pro: $199/month (25 users) ← TARGET (want most customers here)
Pro+: $249/month (25 users + minor extras) ← DECOY
Enterprise: $699/month (unlimited)

DECOY ($249) makes PRO ($199) look like better value
Very few choose Decoy, but it boosts Pro sales by 20-30%

WHY IT WORKS:
People compare options side-by-side
Decoy is obviously worse value than Pro
Makes Pro feel like smart, rational choice
```

**Charm Pricing (Ending in 9)**
```
PRINCIPLE:
$99 feels significantly cheaper than $100 (even though it's $1 difference)

EXAMPLE:
❌ $100/month → ✓ $99/month
❌ $200/month → ✓ $199/month

IMPACT:
2-8% increase in conversion (depending on product)
Works best for B2C and SMB (less effective for Enterprise)

NOTE:
For high-end/premium products, round numbers signal quality
Enterprise SaaS: $1,000/month (not $999)
Luxury: $100 (not $99.99)
```

**Annual vs. Monthly Pricing**
```
OFFER ANNUAL DISCOUNT:
Monthly: $199/month ($2,388/year)
Annual: $1,990/year (save $398 = 17% discount)

BENEFITS:
✓ Upfront cash (improves cash flow)
✓ Lower churn (annual commitment)
✓ Higher LTV (typical annual customer has 2-3x LTV of monthly)
✓ Less payment friction (one charge vs. 12)

DISCOUNT SWEET SPOT:
15-20% discount for annual (industry standard)
Too low (<10%): Not compelling enough
Too high (>25%): Leaving money on table

DISPLAY STRATEGY:
Toggle: [Monthly] [Annual - Save 20%!]
Default to Annual (but allow monthly)
Show monthly price with annual savings callout: "$199/month, or $166/month billed annually"
```

**Price Increase Strategies**
```
WHEN TO RAISE PRICES:
- Regularly (annually or every 18-24 months)
- After adding significant new features
- When costs increase (but don't lead with this)
- When demand exceeds capacity
- When expanding upmarket (repositioning)

HOW MUCH TO INCREASE:
- 5-15% increases are generally well-tolerated
- Larger increases (20%+) require justification (new features, improved service)
- Grandfather existing customers or give 6-12 month notice

COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE:
"We're updating our pricing effective [date] to reflect the value we've added:
- [New feature 1]
- [New feature 2]
- [Improved support/service]

New pricing: $X/month (was $Y/month)

As a valued customer, you can keep your current rate until [date], or lock in our current pricing by switching to an annual plan before [date].

Questions? Email us at [email]."

BEST PRACTICES:
✓ Give 30-60 days notice (build goodwill)
✓ Grandfather existing customers for 6-12 months (reduce churn)
✓ Offer annual plan at old rate as incentive (convert to annual)
✓ Tie increase to value delivered (not inflation or costs)
✗ Don't apologize or over-explain
✗ Don't increase prices for struggling customers (case-by-case)
```

### 5. Pricing Research and Testing

**Customer Interviews (Qualitative)**
```
GOALS:
- Understand customer value perception
- Identify willingness to pay
- Uncover price anchors and alternatives

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. "What problem does our product solve for you?"
2. "What would it cost you if you stopped using our product?" (value anchor)
3. "What did you use before our product? What did that cost?" (competitor anchor)
4. "How do you calculate the ROI of our product?"
5. "If we doubled our price tomorrow, would you still use it? Why or why not?"
6. "If we cut our price in half, would you question the quality?"
7. "What features would justify a 20% price increase?"

PROCESS:
- Interview 10-15 customers across segments (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
- Record and transcribe (with permission)
- Look for patterns in value language
- Create value-based messaging for pricing page

OUTCOME:
Qualitative understanding of value drivers and price sensitivity
```

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (Quantitative)**
```
SURVEY QUESTIONS:
1. "At what price would this product be so expensive that you wouldn't consider it?" (Too Expensive)
2. "At what price would you consider this product expensive, but still might buy it?" (Expensive)
3. "At what price would you consider this product a bargain?" (Cheap)
4. "At what price would this product be so cheap that you'd question its quality?" (Too Cheap)

ANALYSIS:
Plot cumulative distribution curves for each question
Intersections reveal:
- Optimal Price Point (OPP): Intersection of "Too Expensive" and "Too Cheap"
- Indifference Price Point (IPP): Intersection of "Expensive" and "Cheap"

EXAMPLE RESULTS:
Too Cheap: $50
Cheap: $100
Expensive: $200
Too Expensive: $400

Optimal Price Range: $100-$200
Recommended Price: $149 (midpoint, skew toward higher end)

SAMPLE SIZE:
Minimum 50-100 respondents per segment
Survey current customers AND prospects
```

**A/B Price Testing**
```
TEST SETUP:
Version A: $99/month
Version B: $149/month
Split traffic: 50/50

METRICS TO TRACK:
- Conversion rate (trial → paid)
- Revenue per visitor
- Customer LTV (track over 12+ months)

EXAMPLE RESULTS:
Version A ($99): 5% conversion, $4.95 revenue per visitor
Version B ($149): 3.5% conversion, $5.22 revenue per visitor

WINNER: Version B (higher revenue per visitor, despite lower conversion)

CAUTIONS:
⚠️ Don't test if traffic < 1,000 visitors/month (insufficient data)
⚠️ Run test for minimum 4-6 weeks (account for seasonality)
⚠️ Test on new customers only (don't confuse existing customers)
⚠️ Track long-term metrics (higher price may have lower churn)

ADVANCED:
Test different tier structures, not just price points
Test feature allocation (what features at what tier?)
Test messaging and positioning, not just numbers
```

### 6. Discounting Strategy

**When to Discount (Rarely!)**
```
ACCEPTABLE REASONS:
✓ Annual prepayment (15-20% discount)
✓ Multi-year contracts (25-30% discount for 2-3 years)
✓ Startups/nonprofits (case-by-case, capped)
✓ Early customers (beta/launch pricing, time-limited)
✓ Large volume commitments (enterprise deals)
✓ Strategic partnerships (mutual value exchange)

REASONS TO AVOID:
✗ "They asked for a discount" (sets bad precedent)
✗ End-of-quarter sales pressure (trains buyers to wait)
✗ Competitor undercut (race to bottom)
✗ "It's too expensive" objection (likely not price, but value communication)

WHY DISCOUNTS ARE DANGEROUS:
- 10% discount requires 20-30% more volume to maintain profit
- Trains customers to expect discounts (reduces LTV)
- Signals lack of confidence in value
- Creates discount culture (reps give discounts by default)
- Hard to raise prices later (customers remember old price)
```

**Discount Guardrails**
```
RULES:
1. Maximum discount: 20% (without VP approval)
2. Require concession: Annual commit, case study, referral, upsell
3. Time-limited: "This offer expires [date]" (create urgency)
4. Never discount monthly plans (discount annual only)
5. Grandfather pricing ends after 12 months (no permanent discounts)

ALTERNATIVE TO DISCOUNTS:
Instead of: "20% off for first year"
Offer: "Free onboarding ($2,000 value)" or "3 months free if you pay annually"

RESULT:
Same economic value to customer, but preserves price integrity
Easier to maintain full price in year 2
```

**Negotiation Tactics**
```
WHEN PROSPECT SAYS: "It's too expensive"

❌ BAD RESPONSE:
"I can give you 20% off"

✓ GOOD RESPONSE:
"I understand. Can you help me understand what you're comparing our price to?"

→ Uncover real objection (usually not price, but value)
→ Reinforce ROI and value proposition
→ Offer to remove features to hit budget (downgrade to lower tier)

CONCESSION FRAMEWORK:
"I can potentially offer [discount/concession], but I'd need [something in return]"

EXAMPLES:
- "I can offer 15% off if you commit to an annual contract today"
- "I can waive the setup fee if you agree to a case study"
- "I can extend your trial by 2 weeks if you bring in your CFO for a call this week"
- "I can match [competitor price] if you upgrade to our Pro tier"

NEVER:
- Give discount without getting something back
- Discount on first ask (too easy)
- Go below 20% without executive approval
```

### 7. Pricing Page Optimization

**Pricing Page Structure**
```
HERO SECTION:
- Headline: "Simple, transparent pricing" or "Plans that grow with you"
- Subheadline: "No hidden fees. Cancel anytime."
- Toggle: [Monthly] [Annual - Save 20%]

TIER COMPARISON:
- 3-4 tiers displayed side-by-side
- Highlight "Most Popular" or "Best Value" tier (middle)
- Price prominently displayed: "$199/month"
- Billing disclaimer: "Billed annually" or "Billed monthly"
- CTA button: "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started"

FEATURE COMPARISON TABLE:
- Top 10-15 features listed
- Checkmarks or X for each tier
- Expandable sections for detailed features
- Tooltips for technical features (explain in plain language)

SOCIAL PROOF:
- Customer logos (below pricing)
- Testimonials specific to tier ("Enterprise customer saying...")
- "Used by 10,000+ companies" (credibility)

FAQ SECTION:
- "Can I change plans later?" (Yes, anytime)
- "What payment methods do you accept?" (Credit card, invoice for annual)
- "Do you offer refunds?" (30-day money-back guarantee)
- "Is there a contract?" (No contract for monthly, annual for discount)
- "Can I cancel anytime?" (Yes, cancel anytime)

CTA (bottom):
- "Still have questions? Talk to sales" (phone/email)
- "Not sure which plan? Take our quiz" (lead capture)
```

**Psychological Optimization**
```
1. ANCHOR HIGH:
Show Enterprise tier first (left to right) or at top
Makes middle tier look like bargain

2. HIGHLIGHT MIDDLE:
"Most Popular" badge on middle tier (60% should choose this)
Different color or visual emphasis

3. REDUCE FRICTION:
"Start Free Trial" not "Buy Now" (lower commitment)
"No credit card required" (removes barrier)
"Cancel anytime" (reduces risk)

4. SHOW ANNUAL SAVINGS:
"Save $398/year" not just "17% off"
Specific dollar amount more compelling

5. TIER NAMING:
Use aspirational names: "Professional" "Enterprise" (not "Small" "Medium")
Avoid negative connotations: "Basic" OK, "Cheap" or "Limited" bad

6. COMPARISON TABLE:
Start with most important features (top of table)
Use ✓ for included, — for not included (not X, too negative)
Group features by category (easier to scan)

7. SHOW PRICE PER USER:
"$199/month for 10 users = $19.90 per user" (makes it feel cheaper)
Or show yearly cost as monthly: "$1,990/year = $166/month"

8. URGENCY (use sparingly):
"Lock in this price - increasing next month" (if true)
"14-day free trial" (time-bound, but not scammy)
```

## Pricing & Packaging ROI

**Scenario: Repricing from $99 to $149/month (50% increase)**

```
BEFORE (at $99/month):
- 200 customers
- $19,800 MRR
- 10 new customers/month (5% conversion rate)
- CAC: $1,500
- LTV: $3,960 (2-year avg lifecycle)
- LTV:CAC = 2.6:1

AFTER (at $149/month):
- 200 existing customers (grandfathered at $99 for 6 months)
- New customers at $149
- Conversion rate drops to 4% (expected)
- 8 new customers/month

MONTH 6 (after grandfather period ends):
- 150 grandfathered customers stay at $149 (75% accept increase)
- 50 churn (25% churn due to increase)
- 48 new customers acquired (8/month × 6 months)
- Total: 198 customers

MRR: 198 × $149 = $29,502 (+49% MRR growth)

YEAR 1 IMPACT:
Revenue: $19,800 → $29,502 = +$9,702 MRR = +$116,424 annually

New Customer LTV: $149 × 24 months × 80% margin = $2,861... Wait, that's worse!

WAIT - LTV OFTEN INCREASES WITH PRICE:
Higher price → Better customers (more committed) → Lower churn
Assuming churn improves from 4% to 3%:
LTV = $149 × 33 months = $4,917

## Common Pricing Mistakes

**1. Setting Price Too Low**
- **Mistake:** Underpricing to "win deals" or "seem affordable"
- **Impact:** Low margins, attracts wrong customers, hard to raise later
- **Solution:** Price based on value, not cost or competitor pricing

**2. One-Size-Fits-All Pricing**
- **Mistake:** Single tier for all customers (SMB and Enterprise)
- **Impact:** Leave money on table (Enterprise underpays) or lose SMB (too expensive)
- **Solution:** 3-tier pricing to segment customers

**3. Too Many Tiers**
- **Mistake:** 5-7 pricing tiers (paralysis of choice)
- **Impact:** Confusion, indecision, lower conversions
- **Solution:** Max 4 tiers (3 is optimal)

**4. Confusing Feature Differentiation**
- **Mistake:** Unclear why higher tier costs more (vague features)
- **Impact:** Customers default to lowest tier
- **Solution:** Clear, quantified limits (10 users vs 50 users, 1K vs 10K records)

**5. Discounting Too Easily**
- **Mistake:** Giving 20% discount on first objection
- **Impact:** Trains customers to ask for discounts, erodes margins
- **Solution:** Discount only for concessions (annual commit, case study, upsell)

**6. Ignoring Packaging**
- **Mistake:** Focusing only on price, not how features are bundled
- **Impact:** Poor customer segmentation, low expansion revenue
- **Solution:** Strategic feature gating (see Good-Better-Best framework)

**7. Not Reviewing Pricing Regularly**
- **Mistake:** Set price at launch, never revisit
- **Impact:** Inflation erodes margins, miss expansion opportunities
- **Solution:** Review pricing annually, test increases every 18-24 months

**8. Pricing Based on Competitors**
- **Mistake:** "Competitor charges $99, so we'll charge $89"
- **Impact:** Race to bottom, ignores your unique value
- **Solution:** Price based on YOUR value delivered, not competitor pricing

**Next Steps:**
1. Calculate current ARPA and LTV by customer segment
2. Interview 10 customers about value received (qualitative research)
3. Map current features to 3-tier structure (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
4. Test 10-20% price increase on new customers only (A/B test)
5. Add annual billing option with 15-20% discount (cash flow boost)
6. Create pricing calculator or ROI tool for prospects (justification)

**Remember:** Pricing is not "set it and forget it." Review pricing every 12-18 months. Test increases on new customers first. Don't apologize for price—confidently communicate value. A 10% price increase can have more impact than doubling your marketing budget.
