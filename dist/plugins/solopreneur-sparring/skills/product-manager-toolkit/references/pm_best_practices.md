# PM Best Practices and Strategic Pitfalls

## Writing PRDs

- **Problem-First**: Always start with the user pain, not the solution description.
- **Success Metrics**: Define how you will measure success before build starts.
- **Constraints**: Be explicit about what is **out of scope**.
- **Visuals**: Use diagrams and low-fidelity wireframes to reduce ambiguity.

## Stakeholder Management (RACI)

- **Responsible**: The PM/Team building the feature.
- **Accountable**: The person who must sign off on the decision.
- **Consulted**: Experts whose input is needed (Engineering, Design, Legal).
- **Informed**: Those who need to know about the ship (Sales, Support).

## Strategic Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Feature Factory**: Shipping for the sake of shipping without validating impact.
- **Solution Bias**: Jumping to a feature because a competitor has it.
- **Ignoring Tech Debt**: Failing to allocate time for long-term scalability.
- **Metric Theater**: Focusing on numbers that look good but don't drive value.
