# Product Discovery Frameworks

## 1. Customer Interview Guide

- **Context (5 min)**: Role, workflow, current tools.
- **Problem Exploration (15 min)**: Pain points, severity, current workarounds.
- **Validation (10 min)**: Reaction to concepts, value perception.
- **Wrap-up (5 min)**: Referrals and follow-up permission.

## 2. Hypothesis Template

"We believe that **[Feature]** for **[User Segment]** will achieve **[Outcome]**. We'll know we're right when we see **[Target Metric]**."

## 3. Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)

- **Top Level**: Business Outcome (e.g., Increase Retention by 20%).
- **Mid Level**: Opportunities identified during discovery.
- **Bottom Level**: Specific feature solutions to address opportunities.

## 4. Discovery Best Practices

- **Past over Future**: Ask about what users _did_, not what they _will do_.
- **The "Why"**: Use the "5 Whys" technique to dig beneath surface-level feature requests.
- **Bias Avoidance**: Never ask leading questions ("Don't you think this feature would be great?").
