# Content Creation Workflows & Best Practices

## 1. SEO Blog Post Workflow

1. **Keyword Research**: Identify primary (500-5000 vol) and 3-5 secondary keywords.
2. **Structure**: Use the blog template in `references/content_frameworks.md`. Aim for 1,500+ words.
3. **Execution**: Include keywords in Title, first paragraph, and H2 headers.
4. **Optimization**: Run `scripts/seo_optimizer.py`. Adjust density to 1-3%.

## 2. Social Media Repurposing

1. **Selection**: Choose primary platforms based on audience resonance.
2. **Adaptation**: Use the repurposing matrix in `references/content_frameworks.md` to break long-form into snippets.
3. **Checklist**: Validate optimal posting times, image dimensions, and platform-specific hashtags.

## 3. Brand Voice Calibration

1. **Baseline**: Run `scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py` on existing assets.
2. **Archetype**: Select personality archetypes from `references/brand_guidelines.md`.
3. **Validation**: Write 3 sample pieces and re-analyze for consistency.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Keyword Stuffing**: Over-optimizing at the expense of readability.
- **Off-Brand Tone**: Drifting from established voice guidelines.
- **Missing CTAs**: Creating "engagement" without a clear business objective.
- **Algorithm Blindness**: Ignoring platform-specific requirements (video length, image ratios).
