## Core Framework: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

Every high-converting ad follows this psychology:

### **P** - Problem
**Goal:** Identify the pain point

**Example:**
"Struggling to generate consistent B2B leads?"

---

### **A** - Agitate
**Goal:** Make the pain feel urgent

**Example:**
"Most founders waste $10K+ on ads that don't convert. Meanwhile, competitors are stealing your prospects."

---

### **S** - Solution
**Goal:** Present your offer as the answer

**Example:**
"Our proven system generated $5M in pipeline for 200+ B2B companies. Get the framework today."

### Google Search Ad Best Practices

**Keyword insertion:**
```
{KeyWord:Default Text}

Example:
Headline: "{KeyWord:CRM Software} for B2B Teams"

If search = "sales CRM" → "Sales CRM for B2B Teams"
If search = "pipeline tool" → "Pipeline Tool for B2B Teams"
```

**Ad extensions (use these):**
- **Sitelinks:** Additional links (Pricing, Features, Case Studies)
- **Callouts:** Brief benefits ("Free Trial," "24/7 Support")
- **Structured snippets:** Categories (Services: Sales, Marketing, Support)
- **Call extension:** Phone number (mobile clicks-to-call)

**Quality Score optimization:**
- Include exact match keyword in headline
- Match ad copy to landing page copy
- Use keywords in description
- High CTR = higher Quality Score = lower CPC

**Problem:** Ends without telling them what to do
**Fix:** "Download free guide now"

### ❌ Mismatched landing page
**Problem:** Ad promises X, landing page talks about Y
**Fix:** Match ad copy to landing page headline

### ❌ Weak headline
**Problem:** "Check out our product"
**Fix:** "10x Your Sales in 30 Days"

**Fix:** "Limited time: 20% off ends tonight"
