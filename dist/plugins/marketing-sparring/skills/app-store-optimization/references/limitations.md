# ASO Library Limitations & Boundaries

## Data Dependencies

- **Estimated Data**: Keyword search volume is approximate based on indirect indicators.
- **Privacy**: No access to private app console data; public metrics only.

## Platform Constraints

- **Indexing**: Google Play metadata changes take 1-2 hours to reflect.
- **Submissions**: Most Apple App Store metadata changes require a full app update.
- **Proprietary Algorithms**: Store algorithms are non-public and evolve without notice.

## Scope Boundaries

- **Paid Acquisition**: Skill does not cover Apple Search Ads or Google Ads management.
- **Dev/Design**: Does not cover app builds or creative asset creation.
- **Web SEO**: Web search optimization rules do not apply here.

## When NOT to Use

- Enterprise internal apps (not on public stores).
- Web apps.
- Beta/TestFlight-only testing.
