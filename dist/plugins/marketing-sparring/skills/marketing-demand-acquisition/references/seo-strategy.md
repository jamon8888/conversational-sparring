### 3.2 Keyword Strategy Framework

**Keyword Research Process**:

1. **Seed Keywords** - Your product category (e.g., "project management software")
2. **Use Tools** - Ahrefs, SEMrush, or free: Google Keyword Planner + Search Console
3. **Analyze** - Volume, difficulty, intent, SERP features
4. **Prioritize** - Quick wins (low difficulty, high intent)

**Keyword Tiers**:

**Tier 1: High-Intent BOFU** (target first)

- "best [product category]"
- "[product category] for [use case]"
- "[competitor] alternative"
- Volume: 100-1k/mo, Difficulty: Medium, Intent: Commercial

**Tier 2: Solution-Aware MOFU**

- "how to [solve problem]"
- "[problem] solution"
- "[use case] tools"
- Volume: 500-5k/mo, Difficulty: Medium-High, Intent: Informational-Commercial

**Tier 3: Problem-Aware TOFU**

- "what is [concept]"
- "[problem] examples"
- "[industry] challenges"
- Volume: 1k-10k/mo, Difficulty: High, Intent: Informational

**International Keyword Research**:

- Use Ahrefs/SEMrush with language filters

- EU: Higher trust in localized content (domain.de > domain.com/de)
- UK: Use British spelling (optimise vs. optimize)
