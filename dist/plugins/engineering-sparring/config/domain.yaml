# Engineering-specific patterns
patterns:
  safety_shortcuts:
    description: Bypassing safety reviews or procedures
    severity_threshold: 1
    severity: concern
    suggestion: Safety is non-negotiable - follow all review procedures

  documentation_debt:
    description: Completing work without updating documentation
    severity_threshold: 3
