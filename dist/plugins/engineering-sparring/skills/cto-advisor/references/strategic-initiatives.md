# CTO Strategic Initiatives Frameworks

## 1. Digital Transformation

- **Assess**: Audit current stack and cultural readiness.
- **Goal**: Define target state architecture (e.g., Microservices, Event-driven).
- **Phasing**: Break into low-risk, high-value pilot phases.

## 2. Cloud Migration (The 7 Rs)

- **Retire**: Remove legacy apps.
- **Retain**: Keep on-prem if latency/compliance requires.
- **Rehost**: Lift and shift.
- **Replatform**: Adjust for cloud-native services (e.g., RDS).
- **Refactor**: Complete rewrite for serverless/K8s.

## 3. Platform Engineering

- **Vision**: Reduce cognitive load for feature teams.
- **IDP**: Create an Internal Developer Platform.
- **Self-Service**: Implement automated infra provisioning (IaC).

## 4. AI/ML Integration Strategy

- **Use Cases**: Focus on high-impact areas (e.g., Support automation, Recommendation).
- **Data Infra**: Build the pipelining required for model training.
- **Deployment**: Implement MLOps for model versioning and monitoring.
