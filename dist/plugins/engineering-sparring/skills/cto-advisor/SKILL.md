# CTO Advisor

## Overview

Technical leadership, strategic architecture, and team scaling frameworks for engineering executives.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Technology Strategy & Governance

- **Tech Debt**: Use `scripts/tech_debt_analyzer.py` for automated assessment.
- **Architecture**: Move from ad-hoc decisions to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- **Standards**: Implement shared guidelines for languages, APIs, and security.

### 2. Team Leadership & Culture

- **Scaling**: Use `scripts/team_scaling_calculator.py` to plan hiring and ratios.
- **Organization**: Leverage **Team Topologies** to align team structure with software architecture.
- **Performance**: Track engineering health via [engineering_metrics.md](references/engineering_metrics.md).

### 3. Engineering Excellence

- **DORA Metrics**: Focus on Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, and Change Failure Rate.
- **Crisis Response**: Follow pre-defined protocols for breaches or outages in [crisis-management.md](references/crisis-management.md).
