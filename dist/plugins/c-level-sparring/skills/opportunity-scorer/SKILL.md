# Opportunity Scorer

Prioritization framework for opportunities, features, and strategic initiatives using ICE and RICE scoring.

## When to Use

- Opportunity prioritization
- Feature prioritization
- Initiative ranking
- Resource allocation decisions
- Roadmap planning
- Portfolio optimization

## Core Frameworks

### ICE Score

**Formula**: Impact × Confidence × Ease

- **Impact**: 1-10 scale (How much will this move the needle?)
- **Confidence**: 1-10 scale (How confident are we in our estimates?)
- **Ease**: 1-10 scale (How easy is this to execute?)

**Score**: Multiply all three dimensions

### RICE Score

**Formula**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

- **Reach**: Number of users/customers affected per quarter
- **Impact**: 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive)
- **Confidence**: 50-100% (How sure are we?)
- **Effort**: Person-months or story points

**Score**: Higher = Higher priority

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: ICE Prioritization

1. List all opportunities
2. Score each on Impact (1-10)
3. Score each on Confidence (1-10)
4. Score each on Ease (1-10)
5. Calculate ICE score (multiply)
6. Rank by score

### Workflow 2: RICE Prioritization

1. List all opportunities
2. Estimate Reach (users per quarter)
3. Score Impact (0.25-3 scale)
4. Assess Confidence (50-100%)
5. Estimate Effort (person-months)
6. Calculate RICE score
7. Rank and create roadmap

## Portfolio Analysis

### Quick Wins

- High Impact, High Ease, High Confidence
- **Action**: Do immediately

### Big Bets

- High Impact, Low Ease, Medium Confidence
- **Action**: Plan carefully, allocate resources

### Incremental Improvements

- Medium Impact, High Ease, High Confidence
- **Action**: Fill capacity gaps

### Avoid

- Low Impact, Low Ease, Low Confidence
- **Action**: Deprioritize or kill

## Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: All opportunities scored
- **Consistency**: Same scoring criteria applied
- **Validation**: Scores reviewed by stakeholders
- **Documentation**: Rationale for each score documented

## Deliverables

- Prioritized opportunity list
- ICE/RICE scoring matrix
- Portfolio quadrant analysis
- Roadmap recommendations
- Resource allocation plan
