- **Enterprise** (2000+ employees) - Sales-led, field sales, $50k+ ACV

**By Vertical** (choose 2-3 focus verticals):

- Horizontal: Broad appeal (e.g., project management for any industry)
- Vertical: Industry-specific (e.g., healthcare CRM, fintech compliance)

**By Use Case** (messaging varies):

- Use Case A: [e.g., Team collaboration]
