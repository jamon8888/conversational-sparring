# Product Prioritization Frameworks

## 1. RICE Framework

`Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

- **Reach**: Total users affected per time period.
- **Impact**: Multiplier (Massive: 3x, High: 2x, Medium: 1x, Low: 0.5x).
- **Confidence**: Percentage (High: 100%, Medium: 80%, Low: 50%).
- **Effort**: Normalized metric (person-months or story points).

## 2. Value vs Effort Matrix

| Strategic | Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort) | Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Optional  | Fill-ins (Low Value, Low Effort)    | Time Sinks (Low Value, High Effort) |

## 3. MoSCoW Method

- **Must Have**: Non-negotiable for launch or specific milestone.
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical in the current cycle.
- **Could Have**: Desirable features; first to be cut if effort exceeds capacity.
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this lifecycle; recorded for future consideration.

## 4. Prioritization Best Practices

- Consider **Opportunity Cost**: What are we NOT building because of this choice?
- **Buffer**: Always reserve 20% capacity for maintenance and unplanned bugs.
- **Refinement**: Re-score the backlog quarterly as market data changes.
