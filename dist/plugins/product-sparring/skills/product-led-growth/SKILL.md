description: Use when designing product-led growth (PLG) strategies and optimizing self-serve funnels. Trigger when needing to define usage-based value metrics, building freemium-to-paid upgrade paths, or tracking product-qualified leads (PQLs) based on in-app engagement and activation milestones.

# Product-Led Growth

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build PLG strategies. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building PLG Motion

- [ ] Define value metric (usage-based pricing)
- [ ] Create freemium or free trial
- [ ] Build self-serve signup (no sales)
- [ ] Optimize activation (time-to-value)
- [ ] Implement in-app upsells
- [ ] Track product-qualified leads (PQLs)
- [ ] Enable virality (invite teammates)
- [ ] Measure adoption funnel

## Key Frameworks

- **PLG Flywheel**: Acquisition → Activation → Revenue → Referral → Repeat
- **Value Metric**: Price based on value delivered (seats, usage, features)
- **PQL Scoring**: Usage + engagement + fit = qualified lead
- **Self-Serve**: Sign up → activate → upgrade (no sales touch)

## Quick Wins

- Freemium with clear upgrade path
- Invite teammates (viral growth)
- In-app upgrade prompts (usage limits)
- Product analytics for activation tracking
