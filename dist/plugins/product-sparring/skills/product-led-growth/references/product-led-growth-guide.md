# Product-Led Growth: Scale with Self-Serve Excellence

## Overview

Product-Led Growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy where the product itself drives customer acquisition, activation, and expansion. Instead of relying on salespeople to close deals, the product delivers value so effectively that users convert themselves. For solo entrepreneurs and small teams, PLG enables you to scale revenue without scaling headcount linearly.

**When to use this skill:**
- You have a product that delivers value quickly (time-to-value < 1 hour)
- Your product can be self-serve (users can sign up and get value without talking to sales)
- You want to reduce CAC and improve sales efficiency
- You're building a freemium or free-trial business model
- Your ICP includes SMB or individual users (who prefer self-serve)
- You need to prove product-market fit before scaling sales
- You want viral or network-effect growth

**Why Product-Led Growth matters:**
- **Lower CAC:** Self-serve reduces sales costs by 50-70%
- **Faster growth:** No sales bottleneck (scale infinitely)
- **Better product:** Usage data shows what users actually value
- **Higher NRR:** Engaged users expand naturally (upgrade, add seats)
- **Viral loops:** Users invite teammates (built-in distribution)
- **Capital efficiency:** Grow faster with less funding

**Companies that scaled with PLG:**
- Slack: 7M users, $0 in sales/marketing (first 2 years)
- Dropbox: 100M users through referral program
- Zoom: $1B ARR with minimal sales team
- Calendly: 10M+ users, self-serve only
- Notion: Viral growth through templates and sharing

**The cost of ignoring PLG:**
- High CAC ($5,000+ per customer in sales-led SaaS)
- Slow growth (sales team is bottleneck)
- Poor product-market fit signals (sales can sell bad products)
- Miss SMB market (can't afford $50K CAC for $2K ACV customers)

## The PLG Flywheel

### How PLG Compounds Growth

```
THE PLG FLYWHEEL:

1. FREE USER SIGNS UP
   ↓
2. PRODUCT DELIVERS VALUE (Aha Moment)
   ↓
3. USER GETS HOOKED (Daily usage, integrations)
   ↓
4. USER HITS LIMITS (Free plan constraints)
   ↓
5. USER UPGRADES TO PAID (Self-serve checkout)
   ↓
6. USER INVITES TEAM (Collaboration = value)
   ↓
7. TEAM EXPANDS USAGE (More seats, higher tier)
   ↓
8. TEAM REFERS OTHERS (Word-of-mouth, virality)
   ↓
REPEAT (Exponential growth)

COMPOUNDING EFFECTS:
- Each paid customer brings 2-5 free users (viral coefficient)
- Free users convert at 2-10% (continuous revenue stream)
- Paid customers expand 10-30% annually (negative net churn)
- Product improvements benefit ALL users (scale without incremental cost)
```

**PLG Flywheel Example (Slack):**
```
DAY 1: User signs up for free team
DAY 3: Team sends 2,000 messages (Aha Moment: "We're hooked")
DAY 30: Team hits 10,000 message limit (Free plan constraint)
DAY 35: Team upgrades to $8/user/month (Self-serve, credit card)
DAY 60: Team invites external partners (Creates new free teams)
DAY 90: Partners sign up, repeat cycle
RESULT: Viral growth, zero sales team needed
```

## Self-Serve Onboarding

### The First 5 Minutes Are Critical

**Onboarding Goal:** Get user to "Aha Moment" as fast as possible.

**Aha Moment = Moment user experiences core value**

**Examples of Aha Moments:**
```
Slack: Team sends first message (realizes communication is easier)
Dropbox: User uploads and accesses first file (sees value of cloud storage)
Twitter: User follows 30 accounts (feed becomes interesting)
Canva: User creates first design (realizes design is easy)
Notion: User creates first page with blocks (sees flexibility)
Calendly: User books first meeting via link (saves time)

YOUR AHA MOMENT:
Ask: "What action, when completed, makes users say 'I need this'?"
Measure: Time to Aha Moment (median should be <5 minutes for PLG)
Optimize: Reduce steps to Aha Moment
```

### Onboarding Flow Design

**Traditional (Sales-Led) Onboarding:**
```
❌ BAD EXAMPLE:
1. Sign up (name, email, company, role, phone, password)
2. Email verification
3. Sales demo requested (schedule call)
4. Wait 2-3 days for demo
5. Demo call (45 minutes)
6. Follow-up email
7. Trial access granted
8. Setup wizard (30 minutes)
9. Value delivered (if user sticks around)

TIME TO VALUE: 3-7 days
CONVERSION RATE: 30-40% (sales intervention)
CAC: $5,000+ (sales team, demos, follow-up)
```

**Product-Led Onboarding:**
```
✅ GOOD EXAMPLE:
1. Sign up (email + password only, OR Google SSO)
2. Welcome screen ("Here's what you can do")
3. Quick setup (2-3 critical steps with defaults)
4. First value-driving action (create, invite, connect)
5. Aha Moment delivered (instant value)
6. Encourage next action (progressive disclosure)

TIME TO VALUE: 2-5 minutes
CONVERSION RATE: 10-25% (self-serve, no sales)
CAC: $200-500 (product + marketing only)
```

**Onboarding Best Practices:**

**1. Minimize Friction (Get to Value FAST)**
```
REDUCE SIGN-UP FIELDS:
❌ Name, Email, Company, Role, Phone, Industry, Company Size, Password
✅ Email + Password (OR Google/Microsoft SSO)

RESULT:
Sign-up conversion: 15% → 30% (50% fewer fields = 2x conversion)
```

**2. Progressive Onboarding (Don't Overwhelm)**
```
❌ 8-STEP SETUP WIZARD (All at once):
1. Create account
2. Add company info
3. Invite teammates
4. Connect integrations
5. Set up projects
6. Configure settings
7. Watch tutorial videos
8. Complete profile

Completion Rate: 25% (75% abandon)

✅ 2-STEP CRITICAL PATH (Rest is optional):
1. Create account (email)
2. Complete first action (create project, send message, etc.)
   → AHA MOMENT DELIVERED ✓

THEN: Progressive disclosure (tooltips, checklists for advanced features)

Completion Rate: 65% (only essential steps)
```

**3. Use Product Tour (Contextual, Not Upfront)**
```
❌ UPFRONT VIDEO TUTORIAL:
"Welcome! Watch this 5-minute video before you get started."
Result: 80% skip video, 20% watch (most don't retain)

✅ CONTEXTUAL TOOLTIPS:
User hovers on feature → Tooltip appears ("Click here to invite teammates")
User completes action → Checkmark + encouragement
Result: Learn-by-doing (higher retention)

TOOLS:
- Appcues ($300/month): Product tours, tooltips
- Userpilot ($300/month): Onboarding flows
- Pendo ($1,000+/month): Product analytics + onboarding
- Intercom Product Tours ($79/month): In-app messaging
```

**4. Provide Templates (Reduce Blank Canvas Syndrome)**
```
PROBLEM: Users face blank canvas, don't know where to start

❌ Empty state: "Create your first project" (no guidance)
✅ Template gallery: "Start with a template" (pre-populated examples)

EXAMPLES:
- Notion: Page templates (meeting notes, project tracker, wiki)
- Canva: Design templates (Instagram post, presentation, resume)
- Airtable: Base templates (CRM, project management, content calendar)
- Zapier: Zap templates (connect Gmail to Slack, etc.)

RESULT:
Time to first value: 10 minutes → 2 minutes
Activation rate: 40% → 65%
```

**5. Gamify Progress (Onboarding Checklist)**
```
CHECKLIST EXAMPLE:

✅ Create your account (Completed)
✅ Create your first project (Completed)
⬜ Invite a teammate (25% off if you add 2+ users!)
⬜ Connect an integration (Unlock automation)
⬜ Complete your profile

Progress: 2/5 (40%) → Encourage completion

PSYCHOLOGY:
- Zeigarnik Effect: People want to complete started tasks
- Dopamine hit from checking boxes
- Social proof: "90% of users complete this step"

RESULT:
Onboarding completion: 50% → 70%
```

## Activation Metrics

### Defining Activation

**Activation = User reaches "Aha Moment" AND demonstrates engagement**

**Activation Criteria (Choose 2-3 actions):**
```
EXAMPLES BY PRODUCT TYPE:

B2B SaaS (Project Management):
✅ Created first project
✅ Added 2+ tasks
✅ Invited 1+ teammate
✅ Logged in 2+ times within 7 days

Communication Tool:
✅ Sent 2,000+ messages (Slack's metric)
✅ Team has 3+ active members
✅ Used in 3+ different days

Design Tool:
✅ Created first design
✅ Downloaded or shared design
✅ Returned within 7 days

YOUR ACTIVATION METRIC:
Define based on correlation with long-term retention
Ask: "What actions predict 30/60/90-day retention?"
```

### Measuring Activation

**Activation Rate Formula:**
```
Activation Rate = Activated Users / Total Sign-ups × 100%

EXAMPLE:
Sign-ups (last 30 days): 1,000
Activated users (completed Aha Moment + engagement): 350
Activation Rate: 35%

BENCHMARKS:
<20%: Poor (product-market fit issue or bad onboarding)
20-40%: Okay (room for improvement)
40-60%: Good (solid onboarding)
>60%: Excellent (best-in-class)

PLG LEADERS:
Dropbox: 40% activation (file upload + 1 share)
Slack: 30% activation (2,000 messages + 3+ members)
Zoom: 50% activation (first meeting hosted)
```

**Time to Activation:**
```
Median Time to Activation = Time from sign-up to activation (median)

EXAMPLE:
Users: 1,000 sign-ups
- 200 activated within 1 day (20%)
- 150 activated within 3 days (15%)
- 100 activated within 7 days (10%)
Total activated: 450 (45%)

Median Time to Activation: 2 days

GOAL: Reduce median time to <24 hours (ideally <1 hour)

TACTICS:
- Onboarding emails (day 1, day 3 nudges)
- In-app prompts (remind users to complete setup)
- Remove friction (fewer steps, clearer CTAs)
```

**Activation Cohort Analysis:**
```
TRACK ACTIVATION BY COHORT:

Jan 2024 Cohort:
- Sign-ups: 1,000
- Activated (7 days): 380 (38%)
- Activated (30 days): 420 (42%)

Feb 2024 Cohort:
- Sign-ups: 1,200
- Activated (7 days): 540 (45%)
- Activated (30 days): 600 (50%)

INSIGHT:
Feb cohort improved +7pp (improved onboarding flow shipped on Feb 1)
Onboarding changes are working - continue iterating
```

## PQL Scoring (Product-Qualified Leads)

### What is a PQL?

**PQL = Free/trial user showing strong product engagement + fit**

**PQL vs MQL:**
```
MARKETING QUALIFIED LEAD (MQL):
- Downloaded whitepaper
- Attended webinar
- Clicked email link
- Matches ICP (company size, industry)
Problem: Intent signal, but NO product usage

PRODUCT QUALIFIED LEAD (PQL):
- Used product (completed Aha Moment)
- Engaged deeply (daily usage, key features)
- Hit expansion trigger (limits, seats, invites)
- Matches ICP (firmographics)
Result: 3-5x higher conversion than MQL (they've experienced value)

PQL CONVERSION RATES:
MQL → Customer: 5-10%
PQL → Customer: 25-40%

WHY PQLS WIN:
Users who've experienced product value are easier to convert
They're self-qualifying (demonstrated they can use it)
```

### PQL Scoring Model

**4 Dimensions of PQL Scoring:**

**1. Product Usage (40% weight)**
```
SIGNALS:
- Login frequency (daily, weekly)
- Feature adoption (% of core features used)
- Session duration (time spent in product)
- Action depth (created projects, sent messages, etc.)

SCORING:
Daily logins (last 7 days): 10 points
Used 5+ core features: 10 points
Session duration >15 minutes: 5 points
Completed Aha Moment: 15 points

MAX PRODUCT SCORE: 40 points
```

**2. Firmographic Fit (30% weight)**
```
SIGNALS:
- Company size (employees)
- Industry vertical
- Technology stack (what tools they use)
- Geography (US, EU, etc.)

SCORING (Example for B2B SaaS targeting SMB):
Company size 10-50 employees: 15 points
Company size 50-200 employees: 10 points
Company size <10 employees: 5 points
Target industry (SaaS, tech): 10 points
Non-target industry: 5 points

MAX FIRMOGRAPHIC SCORE: 30 points
```

**3. Behavioral Intent (20% weight)**
```
SIGNALS:
- Visited pricing page (buying intent)
- Invited teammates (expansion signal)
- Requested features (engaged, considering)
- Approaching limits (ready to upgrade)
- Attended webinar/demo (learning mode)

SCORING:
Visited pricing page 3+ times: 10 points
Invited 2+ teammates: 5 points
Approaching plan limit (80%+ usage): 5 points

MAX BEHAVIORAL SCORE: 20 points
```

**4. Engagement Recency (10% weight)**
```
SIGNALS:
- Last login date (active vs dormant)
- Streak (consecutive days of usage)

SCORING:
Active today: 10 points
Active within 3 days: 7 points
Active within 7 days: 5 points
Active within 14 days: 2 points
Inactive 14+ days: 0 points

MAX ENGAGEMENT SCORE: 10 points
```

**Total PQL Score:**
```
PQL Score = Product (40) + Firmographic (30) + Behavioral (20) + Engagement (10)
MAX SCORE: 100 points

PQL TIERS:
A-Tier PQL (Hot): 80-100 points → Immediate sales outreach
B-Tier PQL (Warm): 60-79 points → Automated email nurture
C-Tier PQL (Cold): 40-59 points → In-app messaging, self-serve
Not Qualified: <40 points → Monitor, drip nurture

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:

User: Sarah (Acme Corp)
- Product: 35 points (daily usage, 8 features used, Aha Moment completed)
- Firmographic: 25 points (50 employees, SaaS industry, US)
- Behavioral: 15 points (visited pricing 5x, invited 3 teammates)
- Engagement: 10 points (active today)
TOTAL: 85 points (A-Tier PQL)

ACTION: Sales rep reaches out within 24 hours
```

## Usage-Based Health Scoring

### Tracking Customer Health

**Health Score = Predictive metric for retention/churn**

**Health Score Components (for PLG):**

**1. Product Usage (50% weight)**
```
METRICS:
- Login frequency (DAU/MAU ratio)
- Feature breadth (% of features used)
- Feature depth (frequency of core feature usage)
- Data volume (records created, messages sent, etc.)

GOOD HEALTH:
- DAU/MAU >40% (daily active users / monthly active)
- 70%+ of core features used
- Core feature used daily
- Growing data volume (trend up)

POOR HEALTH:
- DAU/MAU <20% (weekly or less usage)
- <30% of core features used
- Declining usage trend (week-over-week)
- Stagnant or shrinking data
```

**2. Team Adoption (25% weight)**
```
METRICS (for multi-seat products):
- Seat utilization (% of purchased seats active)
- Collaboration actions (sharing, commenting, @mentions)
- Admin engagement (admins actively managing)

GOOD HEALTH:
- 80%+ seat utilization (most seats active)
- Frequent collaboration (daily shares/comments)
- Admin active weekly (managing team)

POOR HEALTH:
- <50% seat utilization (wasted licenses)
- No collaboration (siloed usage)
- Admin inactive 30+ days (no governance)
```

**3. Expansion Indicators (15% weight)**
```
SIGNALS:
- Approaching limits (storage, seats, API calls)
- Requesting features (engaged, invested)
- Inviting new users (organic growth)

GOOD HEALTH:
- 70%+ of plan limit used (ready to upgrade)
- Invited 3+ new users (last 30 days)
- Requested premium features (buying signals)

POOR HEALTH:
- <20% of plan limit used (overprovisioned)
- No invites (no growth)
- No feature requests (disengaged)
```

**4. Sentiment & Support (10% weight)**
```
METRICS:
- Support ticket volume (fewer = healthier)
- NPS/CSAT scores (satisfaction)
- Feature feedback (positive vs negative)

GOOD HEALTH:
- 0-1 support tickets/quarter (self-sufficient)
- NPS >50 (promoter)
- Positive feature feedback

POOR HEALTH:
- 5+ tickets/quarter (struggling)
- NPS <0 (detractor)
- Negative feedback or complaints
```

**Health Score Calculation:**
```
EXAMPLE:

Customer: TechCo
- Product Usage: 45/50 points (daily usage, 75% features, growing data)
- Team Adoption: 20/25 points (80% seats active, frequent collaboration)
- Expansion: 12/15 points (85% of plan limit, invited 5 users)
- Sentiment: 8/10 points (NPS 60, 1 ticket last quarter)

HEALTH SCORE: 85/100 (Healthy - Green)

ACTIONS:
- Monitor for upgrade opportunity (at 85% of plan limit)
- Request case study (NPS 60 = promoter)
- Minimal CS touch needed (healthy, self-sufficient)
```

**Health-Based Segmentation:**
```
GREEN (80-100): Healthy, expansion candidates
- Action: Upsell, request referral/testimonial
- CS Touch: Quarterly check-in (low-touch)

YELLOW (60-79): Stable, monitor
- Action: Feature adoption campaigns, engagement nudges
- CS Touch: Monthly check-in

ORANGE (40-59): At-Risk, intervention needed
- Action: Proactive outreach, identify pain points, training
- CS Touch: Weekly check-in, account review

RED (0-39): Critical, likely to churn
- Action: Executive escalation, save offer, exit interview
- CS Touch: Daily check-in or let churn (if unresponsive)
```

## In-App Messaging

### Contextual Prompts (Not Spam)

**In-App Messaging Principles:**
```
✅ GOOD IN-APP MESSAGING:
- Contextual (shown when relevant, not random)
- Helpful (solves user problem, not company goal)
- Timely (right moment in user journey)
- Dismissable (user has control)
- Personalized (based on usage, role, stage)

❌ BAD IN-APP MESSAGING:
- Popup spam ("Upgrade now!" every login)
- Irrelevant ("Try feature X" when user is busy with Y)
- Annoying frequency (same message daily)
- Blocking UI (modal that prevents work)
```

**In-App Message Types:**

**1. Onboarding Tooltips (First-Time User Experience)**
```
TRIGGER: User logs in for first time

MESSAGE:
"👋 Welcome! Let's create your first project."
[CTA: Create Project]

DISMISSABLE: Yes
FREQUENCY: Once (never show again after dismissed)

GOAL: Guide to Aha Moment
```

**2. Feature Announcements (New Capabilities)**
```
TRIGGER: User logs in after new feature ships

MESSAGE:
"✨ New: Export to PDF
You can now export your reports to PDF. Try it!"
[CTA: Learn More] [CTA: Dismiss]

DISMISSABLE: Yes
FREQUENCY: Once per feature launch

GOAL: Drive feature adoption
```

**3. Usage Limit Warnings (Upgrade Triggers)**
```
TRIGGER: User hits 80% of plan limit

MESSAGE:
"⚠️ You're at 80% of your storage limit.
Upgrade to Pro for unlimited storage."
[CTA: View Plans] [CTA: Dismiss]

DISMISSABLE: Yes
FREQUENCY: Once at 80%, again at 90%, again at 100%

GOAL: Drive upgrades (self-serve conversion)
```

**4. Engagement Nudges (Re-Activate Dormant Users)**
```
TRIGGER: User hasn't logged in for 7 days

MESSAGE (Email + In-App):
"We miss you! 👋
You haven't logged in for a week. Here's what's new..."
[CTA: View Updates]

DISMISSABLE: Yes
FREQUENCY: Day 7, Day 14, Day 30 (then stop)

GOAL: Re-activate dormant users, prevent churn
```

**5. Social Proof (Build Trust)**
```
TRIGGER: User on pricing page

MESSAGE:
"🚀 Join 50,000+ teams already using [Product]
Companies like Acme, TechCo, and StartupX trust us."

DISMISSABLE: No (subtle banner, not blocking)
FREQUENCY: Always shown (context-dependent)

GOAL: Reduce pricing page drop-off
```

**In-App Messaging Tools:**
```
- **Intercom** ($79+/month): Messaging, support, product tours
- **Appcues** ($300+/month): Onboarding flows, tooltips, modals
- **Pendo** ($1,000+/month): Product analytics + in-app guides
- **Userpilot** ($300+/month): Onboarding, feature adoption
- **Chameleon** ($280+/month): Product tours, surveys, tooltips
- **Beamer** ($49+/month): Changelog, announcements, NPS
```

## Self-Serve Monetization

### Pricing for PLG

**PLG Pricing Principles:**

**1. Free Plan (Top of Funnel)**
```
PURPOSE:
- Drive adoption (lower barrier to entry)
- Viral distribution (free users invite others)
- Product validation (users test before buying)

FREE PLAN SHOULD:
✅ Deliver real value (not a trial, but limited version)
✅ Have clear limits (storage, seats, features)
✅ Create desire for paid (users hit limits naturally)

EXAMPLES:
- Slack: Free up to 10,000 messages
- Notion: Free for personal use, unlimited pages
- Calendly: Free 1 event type, 15min/30min/60min slots
- Canva: Free templates, limited exports

FREE PLAN LIMITS:
- Usage-based (messages, storage, API calls)
- Feature-based (advanced features locked)
- Seat-based (1 user free, team requires paid)
- Time-based (7-14 day trial, then downgrade to free)
```

**2. Pricing Tiers (Good-Better-Best)**
```
STRUCTURE:
Free → Starter ($X) → Pro ($Y) → Enterprise ($Z)

ANCHOR PRICING:
- Most users choose middle tier (Pro)
- Starter = entry point (cost-conscious)
- Enterprise = expansion (high-value customers)

EXAMPLE (Notion):
Free: Personal use
Plus: $8/user/month (small teams)
Business: $15/user/month (larger teams, advanced features)
Enterprise: Custom (SSO, advanced admin, SLA)

PRICING GAPS:
- Don't make gaps too small ($8 → $10 = cannibalization)
- Don't make gaps too large ($8 → $50 = sticker shock)
- Aim for 2-3x between tiers ($8 → $20 → $50)
```

**3. Usage-Based Pricing (Align with Value)**
```
CHARGE BASED ON:
- Seats/users (per-user pricing)
- Storage (per GB)
- API calls (per 1,000 calls)
- Records/contacts (CRM-style)
- Compute/credits (usage-based)

PROS:
- Aligns cost with value (use more = pay more)
- Expansion revenue (customers grow, revenue grows)
- Fair (small customers pay less, large pay more)

CONS:
- Unpredictable revenue (usage fluctuates)
- Billing complexity (metering, invoicing)

EXAMPLES:
- AWS: Pay for compute, storage, bandwidth used
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Twilio: Pay per SMS/call
- Snowflake: Pay per data storage + compute

HYBRID MODEL (Best of Both):
Base fee ($50/month) + usage overages (per 1,000 API calls)
```

### Self-Serve Checkout

**Remove Sales Friction:**
```
PLG CHECKOUT:
✅ Credit card self-serve (no sales call needed)
✅ Instant access (upgrade immediately)
✅ Transparent pricing (no "Contact Us")
✅ Monthly + annual options (flexibility)
✅ Cancel anytime (reduce risk)

SALES-LED CHECKOUT:
❌ "Contact Us for Pricing" (hidden pricing)
❌ Demo required (2-3 day delay)
❌ Contract negotiation (legal review)
❌ Annual contract only (commitment fear)
❌ Cancellation requires call (friction)

PLG WINS:
Conversion rate: 25-40% (self-serve)
Sales-led conversion: 10-15% (high friction)
Time to revenue: Instant (vs 30-60 days)
```

**Upgrade Triggers (When to Prompt):**
```
1. LIMIT HIT:
   User hits 90% of free plan storage → "Upgrade for unlimited"

2. FEATURE REQUEST:
   User clicks locked feature → "Unlock with Pro plan"

3. TEAM GROWTH:
   User invites 5+ teammates → "Upgrade for team features"

4. MILESTONE CELEBRATION:
   User completes 100 projects → "You're a power user! Unlock Pro"

5. TIME-BASED:
   Day 14 of 30-day trial → "Upgrade now, save 20%"

6. ENGAGEMENT SPIKE:
   User has 5 active days in a row → "Loving it? Upgrade for advanced features"
```

**Pricing Page Optimization:**
```
BEST PRACTICES:
✅ Show monthly + annual (with discount: "Save 20%")
✅ Highlight recommended tier ("Most Popular")
✅ Compare features (feature table)
✅ Social proof (customer logos, testimonials)
✅ FAQ section (answer objections)
✅ CTA on every tier ("Start Free" vs "Upgrade Now")
✅ Trust signals (security badges, uptime SLA)

A/B TEST:
- Monthly vs annual default
- 3 tiers vs 4 tiers
- Pricing labels ("Professional" vs "Pro")
- Feature descriptions (features vs outcomes)
```

## PLG Playbook by Stage

### Stage 1: Pre-Launch (Validation)

**Goal:** Prove product-market fit

**Tactics:**
- Build MVP with core value (minimal features)
- Launch to 50-100 early adopters (hand-pick)
- Measure: Do they use it daily? Do they refer others?
- Iterate based on feedback (weekly releases)
- Aim for 40%+ retention (30-day cohort)

**Success Criteria:**
- 40%+ weekly retention (users come back)
- NPS >30 (users would recommend)
- Organic referrals happening (product is sticky)

### Stage 2: Early Growth (0-100 Customers)

**Goal:** Refine onboarding, prove conversion

**Tactics:**
- Simplify onboarding (reduce time to Aha Moment)

## Common PLG Mistakes

### ❌ No Clear Aha Moment
**Problem:** Users sign up but don't understand value
**Fix:** Define Aha Moment, optimize onboarding to get there fast

### ❌ Too Much Friction
**Problem:** 8-step onboarding wizard, email verification, phone number required
**Fix:** Reduce to 1-2 critical steps, use SSO, progressive disclosure

### ❌ Free Plan Too Generous
**Problem:** Users never hit limits, no reason to upgrade
**Fix:** Set limits that 20-30% of active users hit (storage, seats, features)

### ❌ Free Plan Too Restrictive
**Problem:** Free plan has no value, users don't activate
**Fix:** Free plan should deliver real value (not just a trial)

### ❌ No Pricing Transparency
**Problem:** "Contact Us for Pricing" on self-serve product
**Fix:** Show pricing publicly, allow self-serve checkout

### ❌ Ignoring Activation
**Problem:** Focus on sign-ups, ignore activation rate
**Fix:** Activation > acquisition (activated users convert, sign-ups don't)

### ❌ No Product-Led Sales
**Problem:** Pure self-serve, miss high-value expansion opportunities
**Fix:** Add PQL scoring, sales assists for enterprise deals
