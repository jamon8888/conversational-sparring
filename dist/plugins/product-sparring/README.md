## ❓ Why This Plugin is Different

Most AI plugins are just **Toolboxes** - they give you a hammer and saw but don't tell you how to build a house.

**Product Sparring** is a **Thinking Partner**. It combines:
1.  **Expert Agents**: A "Sparring Mentor" who knows the best frameworks (e.g., First Principles, Jobs-to-be-Done, RICE).
2.  **Proactive Challenge**: It doesn't just answer; it asks "Is this the right problem?" and "Have you considered X?"
3.  **Deep Skills**: A library of 21 professional skills (not just distinct scripts, but integrated workflows).

It doesn't just execute commands; it **elevates your thinking**.
