# ASO Best Practices

## Keyword Research

1. **Volume vs. Competition**: Balance high-volume terms with those where you can realistically reach the top 10.
2. **Relevance**: Only target keywords that match your app's core functionality.
3. **Long-Tail**: Target 3-4 word phrases with lower competition.
4. **Consistency**: Research keywords quarterly; trends change.

## Metadata Optimization

1. **Front-Loading**: Place critical keywords at the beginning of the title.
2. **Human First**: Write for conversion, then optimize for algorithms.
3. **A/B Testing**: Systematically test titles and descriptions.
4. **No Spacing**: In Apple's keyword field, use `word1,word2,word3` (no spaces).

## Visual Assets

1. **Icon**: Recognition is key at 60x60px.
2. **Screenshots**: The first 2-3 are critical; use captions to tell a benefit-driven story.
3. **Consistency**: Align visual style with the app's internal UI/UX.

## Review Management

1. **Respond Fast**: Aim for 24-48 hour response times.
2. **Professionalism**: Remain courteous and addressing specific technical issues.
3. **Strategic Prompts**: Request ratings only after positive user milestones (e.g., first success).
