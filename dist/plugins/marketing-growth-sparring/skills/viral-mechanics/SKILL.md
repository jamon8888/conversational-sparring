# Viral Mechanics

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build virality and network effects into your product. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/viral-mechanics-guide.md).

## Tools & Scripts

**Viral Coefficient Calculator** (`scripts/viral_coefficient_calculator.py`):

```bash
python scripts/viral_coefficient_calculator.py <input>
```

Calculates the K-factor based on invites sent and conversion rates.

## Execution Checklist

### Building Virality

- [ ] Identify network effect type (direct, indirect, data, platform)
- [ ] Define viral loop trigger (when users should share)
- [ ] Design reward/incentive for sharing
- [ ] Minimize sharing friction (1-2 clicks max)
- [ ] Optimize landing page for recipients
- [ ] Track K-factor (invites × conversion)
- [ ] Calculate viral cycle time

## Key Frameworks

- **Viral Growth Formula**: K = i × c (Invites sent per user × Conversion rate)
- **The Viral Multiplier**: Compounding growth through user-to-user referrals
- **STEPPS Model**: Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, Stories
- **Network Effects**: Metcalfe's Law (V = n²), two-sided marketplaces, data flywheels

## Quick Wins

- Double-sided incentives (motivate both referrer and referee)
- Contextual triggers (ask for share after a "win" or value realization)
- One-click social sharing and contact imports
- "Powered by" footer/watermark for built-in visibility
