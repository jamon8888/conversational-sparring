# Handoff Protocols
### 7.1 MQL → SQL Handoff (Marketing → Sales)

**SQL Definition Criteria** (customize for your ICP):

```
Required:
✅ Job title: Director+ (or Budget Authority confirmed)
✅ Company size: 50-5000 employees
✅ Budget: $10k+ annual (or Qualified Need confirmed)
✅ Timeline: Buying within 90 days
✅ Engagement: Demo requested OR High intent action

Optional:
✅ Industry: Target verticals
✅ Geography: US/CA/EU
✅ Use case: Matches product capabilities
```

**HubSpot Workflow**:

1. Lead reaches MQL threshold (lead score >75)
2. Trigger: Automated email to SDR
3. SDR qualification call (BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
4. If qualified → Mark as SQL, assign to AE
5. If not qualified → Recycle to nurture, adjust lead score

**SLA** (Service Level Agreement):

- SDR responds to MQL: 4 hours
- AE books demo with SQL: 24 hours
- First demo: Within 3 business days of SQL status

### 7.2 SQL → Opportunity Handoff (Sales → RevOps)

**Opportunity Creation**:

- AE creates opportunity in HubSpot after first demo
- Required fields: Company, Deal value, Close date, Stage
- Pipeline stages: Discovery → Demo → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost

**Marketing Support Post-SQL**:

- Retargeting ads to target accounts (ABM)
- Send case studies, ROI calculator
- Invite to customer webinar
- Executive briefing (for Enterprise deals)

### 7.3 Lost Opportunity Handoff (Sales → Marketing)

**Recycle to Nurture**:

- Reason: No budget, bad timing, wrong fit
- Action: Move to "Nurture" list in HubSpot
- Sequence: Quarterly check-in emails, invite to webinars
- Re-engage: After 6-12 months, SDR re-qualification
