description: Use when designing growth experiments and testing marketing hypotheses. Trigger when needing to formulate 'If X, then Y' hypotheses with defined success metrics, calculating required sample sizes for statistical significance (p-value < 0.05), or managing an experimentation repository of wins and iterations.

# Experiment Design

## Quick Start

This skill helps you run growth experiments. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Running an Experiment

- [ ] Form hypothesis (If X, then Y, because Z)
- [ ] Define success metric
- [ ] Calculate sample size
- [ ] Design A/B test
- [ ] Set experiment duration
- [ ] Run test (track both variants)
- [ ] Analyze results (statistical significance)
- [ ] Ship winner or iterate

## Key Frameworks

- **Hypothesis Format**: "If [change], then [outcome], because [insight]"
- **Success Metrics**: Primary (1) + Secondary (2-3)
- **Statistical Significance**: p-value < 0.05, confidence 95%+
- **Sample Size**: Use calculator (conversion rate, MDE)

## Quick Wins

- Start with high-traffic pages (faster results)
- Test one variable at a time
- Run for full weeks (avoid day-of-week effects)
- Document all experiments (learning repository)
