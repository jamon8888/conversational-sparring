## ❓ Why This Plugin is Different

Most AI plugins are just **Toolboxes** - they give you a hammer and saw but don't tell you how to build a house.

**Strategic Research Sparring** is a **Cognitive System**, not just a script runner.

### 🧠 The Cognitive Difference
1.  **Shared Memory (`lib`)**: Unlike stateless plugins, this system **remembers**. It uses a shared cognitive library to track your goals, preferences, and project history across sessions.
2.  **Episodic Context**: It maintains state files (contracts, memory banks) so you don't have to repeat your context every time.
3.  **Proactive Challenge**: It doesn't just answer; it uses the "Sparring Mentor" architecture to challenge assumptions and force deeper thinking.

It doesn't just execute commands; it **thinks with you**.
