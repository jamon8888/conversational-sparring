## Short-Form Video Strategy

### Hook Frameworks (First 3 Seconds)

**1. Question Hook**
```
"Want to know how I got 100K followers in 60 days?"
"What if I told you this productivity hack is a lie?"
```

**2. Stat/Number Hook**
```
"I analyzed 1,000 viral videos. Here's what works:"
"3 mistakes costing you 90% of your views:"
```

**3. Bold Statement**
```
"Most business advice is wrong."
"This AI tool will replace [job] by 2025."
```

**4. Visual Pattern Interrupt**
```
[Fast transition]
[Unexpected action]
[Text on screen: "WAIT"]
```

---

### Short-Form Script Template (30-60 sec)

```
00:00-00:03 - HOOK (question, stat, bold claim)
00:03-00:08 - Context (why this matters)
00:08-00:45 - Main value (3 tips, framework, story)
00:45-00:60 - CTA (follow, like, comment)
```

**Example:**
```
[HOOK] 3 TikTok mistakes killing your views:

[CONTEXT] I grew to 100K in 90 days. Here's what NOT to do:

[VALUE]
1. Bad hooks - First 3 seconds must stop scroll
2. Slow pacing - Cut every 2-3 seconds
3. No CTA - Always tell viewers what to do

[CTA] Follow for daily social media tips →
```

---

### Editing for Short-Form

**Pacing:**
- Cut every 2-3 seconds (keeps attention)
- Remove pauses (dead air = swipe away)
- Add transitions (fast cuts, zooms)

**Captions:**
- 80% watch without sound
- Use auto-captions (TikTok/IG built-in)
- Or add manually (CapCut)

**Music:**
- Trending audio (TikTok/Reels algorithm boost)
- Or royalty-free (Epidemic Sound, Artlist)

**Effects:**
- Minimal (content > flashy effects)
- Text overlays (highlight key points)
- B-roll (visual variety)
