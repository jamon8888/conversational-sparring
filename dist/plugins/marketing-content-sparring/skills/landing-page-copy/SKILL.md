## Execution Checklist

### Creating a Landing Page

- [ ] Define goal (lead capture, sale, signup)
- [ ] Identify target audience and pain points
- [ ] Choose framework (AIDA, PAS, or Before-After-Bridge)
- [ ] Write compelling hero headline (value + outcome)
- [ ] Craft subheadline (expand on promise)
- [ ] List 3-5 key benefits (not features)
- [ ] Add social proof (testimonials, logos, stats)
- [ ] Create clear, singular CTA
- [ ] Design for scannability (bullets, headers, white space)
- [ ] Test readability (target 60+ Flesch score)
- [ ] Optimize for mobile
- [ ] A/B test variations

## Key Frameworks

- **AIDA**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
- **PAS**: Problem → Agitate → Solution
- **Before-After-Bridge**: Current state → Desired state → Your solution
- **Hero Headline Formula**: `[Verb] [Result] in [Timeframe] without [Pain Point]`
- **CTA Best Practices**: Action verb + Benefit + Urgency

## Metrics Benchmarks

- **Conversion rate**: 2-5% (good), 10%+ (excellent)
- **Time on page**: 2+ minutes
- **Bounce rate**: <50%
- **click-through rate**: 5-10%

## Quick Wins

- Use numbers in headlines ("3x faster", "50% more leads")
- Add urgency to CTA ("Limited spots", "Ends Friday")
- Show social proof above fold ("Join 10,000 entrepreneurs")
- Keep hero section to 2-3 short paragraphs max
- Use benefit-driven bullets, not feature lists
