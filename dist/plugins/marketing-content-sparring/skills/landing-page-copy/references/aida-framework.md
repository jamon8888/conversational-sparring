# AIDA Framework for Landing Pages

## Overview
AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) is a proven copywriting framework for high-converting landing pages.

## The Four Stages

### 1. Attention (Above the Fold)
**Goal**: Stop visitors and make them want to learn more

**Components**:
- **Headline**: Clear value proposition (6-10 words)
- **Subheadline**: Specific benefit + objection handling
- **Hero visual**: Product in action or result achieved
- **Primary CTA**: Clear next step

**Headline Formulas**:
```
"[Achieve Result] Without [Common Objection]"
→ "Get 100 Qualified Leads Per Month Without Cold Calling"

"The [Adjective] Way to [Desired Outcome]"
→ "The Fastest Way to Build Your Email List"

"[Do Thing] Like [Aspirational Group]"
→ "Close Deals Like Top 1% Sales Reps"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Test in 5-second rule (can visitor understand offer in 5 seconds?)
- Use benefit-driven language
- Include social proof bar (logos)
- Make CTA stand out visually

### 2. Interest (Problem/Solution)
**Goal**: Build relevance and show you understand their pain

**Structure**:
```
Problem Section:
- Heading: "Is [Problem] slowing you down?"
- 3 pain points with icons
- Agitate each pain point

Solution Section:
- Heading: "The new way to [Result]"
- 3-step process
- Screenshots/visuals for each step
```

**Pain Point Formula**:
```
[Icon] Pain Point Title
Description of the frustration and cost
```

**Example**:
```
❌ Manual Prospecting Takes Hours
You're spending 3+ hours per day searching for leads on LinkedIn,
leaving no time for actual selling.
```

### 3. Desire (Social Proof + Benefits)
**Goal**: Make them want your solution

**Components**:
- **Testimonials**: 3-5 customer quotes with photos
- **Case studies**: Specific results with numbers
- **Feature-benefit list**: What it does + why it matters
- **Comparison table**: You vs. alternatives

**Testimonial Structure**:
```
"[Specific result achieved in timeframe]"
- Name, Title, Company
[Star rating or logo]
```

**Feature-Benefit Translation**:
```
Feature: "AI-powered lead scoring"
Benefit: "Focus on the 20% of leads that drive 80% of revenue"
```

### 4. Action (CTA + Risk Reversal)
**Goal**: Remove friction and drive conversion

**Components**:
- **Heading**: "Ready to [Result]?"
- **Subhead**: Social proof ("Join 10,000+ users")
- **Primary CTA button**: Action-oriented text
- **Risk reversal**: Guarantee, free trial, no credit card
- **Secondary CTA**: Alternative low-commitment option

**CTA Button Text**:
```
❌ Generic: "Submit", "Click Here"
✅ Specific: "Get My Free Template", "Start Free Trial"
```

**Risk Reversal Examples**:
- "14-day free trial, no credit card required"
- "30-day money-back guarantee"
- "Cancel anytime, keep the bonuses"
