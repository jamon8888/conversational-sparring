## When to Use This Skill

- Starting your first podcast
- Growing podcast audience
- Improving audio quality
- Planning podcast content
- Monetizing your show
- Launching interview series
- Repurposing podcast content

---

## Getting Started

### Should You Start a Podcast?

**Podcasting is ideal if:**
- ✅ You enjoy talking (comfortable speaking for 20-60 min)
- ✅ You have a specific audience/niche
- ✅ You can commit to consistency (weekly or biweekly)
- ✅ You want to build authority and relationships
- ✅ Your audience consumes audio content

**Podcasting might not be ideal if:**
- ❌ You're camera-shy AND mic-shy
- ❌ You can't commit to regular episodes
- ❌ Your niche is highly visual
- ❌ You need immediate results (podcasts build slowly)

---

## Podcast Setup (Week 1)

### Step 1: Define Your Podcast

**Format:**
```
Solo show - You talk alone (easiest to produce)
Interview show - You + guests (builds relationships)
Co-hosted - You + co-host (more dynamic)
Panel/Roundtable - Multiple guests (complex)
```

**Niche:**
```
Too broad: "Business podcast"
Good: "B2B SaaS sales tactics for founders"

Too broad: "Marketing podcast"
Good: "Content marketing for solo entrepreneurs"
```

**Frequency:**
```
Daily - High commitment, fast growth
Weekly - Sustainable for most
Biweekly - Easier, slower growth
Monthly - Minimal growth

Recommendation: Start weekly
```

**Episode Length:**
```
15-20 min - Quick tips, solo shows
30-40 min - Interviews, deep dives
60+ min - Long-form, guests

Recommendation: 30-40 min (sweet spot)
```

---

### Step 2: Equipment (Budget Tiers)

**Starter Setup ($100-200):**
```
Microphone: Audio-Technica ATR2100x ($99)
Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-M20x ($49)
Recording software: Audacity (free) or GarageBand (free, Mac)

Total: ~$150
```

**Intermediate Setup ($300-500):**
```
Microphone: Shure MV7 ($249)
Audio interface: Focusrite Scarlett Solo ($120)
Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x ($149)
Recording software: Audacity (free)

Total: ~$500
```

**Professional Setup ($800-1,500):**
```

Audio interface: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 ($180)
Cloudlifter CL-1 (for SM7B): $149
Headphones: Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO ($159)
Recording software: Adobe Audition ($20/mo)

```

**Recommendation:** Start with Starter or Intermediate. Upgrade when you hit 1,000 downloads/episode.

```

## Recording Best Practices

### Pre-Recording Checklist

**Environment:**
