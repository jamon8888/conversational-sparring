# SEO Blog Writing

## Quick Start

This skill helps you write blog posts that rank on Google and drive organic traffic. For complete SEO frameworks and examples, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

**Keyword Analyzer** (`scripts/keyword_analyzer.py`):

python scripts/keyword_analyzer.py "your keyword"
```

Analyzes keyword difficulty, search volume, and competition.

## Execution Checklist
