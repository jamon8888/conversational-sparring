# Product Launch Orchestration

## Quick Start

This skill helps you orchestrate successful product launches. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Product Launch (6-8 weeks)

- [ ] Week -8: Define launch goals and messaging
- [ ] Week -6: Create launch assets (landing page, demo, deck)
- [ ] Week -4: Build early access list / beta
- [ ] Week -3: PR outreach and content creation
- [ ] Week -2: Tease launch (social, email, blog)
- [ ] Week -1: Final prep and team alignment
- [ ] Week 0: LAUNCH across all channels
- [ ] Week +1: Follow up, gather feedback, optimize
- [ ] Week +2: Post-launch analysis and celebration

## Key Frameworks

- **Launch Timeline**: Tease (2 weeks) → Announce (launch day) → Amplify (week 1) → Sustain (ongoing)
- **Channel Mix**: Email + Social + PR + Ads + Partners + Product Hunt
- **Messaging**: Problem → Solution → Differentiation → Proof → CTA

## Quick Wins

- Build waitlist before launch (creates FOMO)
- Partner with influencers/complementary products
- Create launch exclusive (limited-time offer)
- Use Product Hunt for visibility
