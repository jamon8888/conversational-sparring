# Sales-Marketing Alignment: End the Blame Game, Drive Revenue

## Overview

Sales-marketing alignment is the practice of creating shared goals, processes, and definitions between sales and marketing teams to maximize revenue. For solo entrepreneurs and small teams, misalignment creates friction, wasted leads, and missed revenue—while alignment creates a predictable, scalable revenue engine.

**When to use this skill:**
- Sales complains "marketing leads don't convert"
- Marketing complains "sales doesn't follow up on leads"
- You can't agree on lead quality or volume goals
- Leads get lost in the handoff from marketing to sales
- No clear definition of what makes a "qualified lead"
- Sales and marketing optimize for different metrics
- You're missing revenue targets due to team dysfunction
- You're scaling and need repeatable processes

**Why sales-marketing alignment matters:**
- **Revenue impact:** Aligned companies grow revenue 32% faster (Forrester)
- **Lead conversion:** Aligned teams see 38% higher win rates (MarketingProfs)
- **Efficiency:** 67% shorter sales cycles with alignment (IDG)
- **Retention:** Aligned companies retain 36% more customers (Forrester)
- **Pipeline predictability:** Shared definitions create accurate forecasting
- **Team morale:** Reduces finger-pointing, increases collaboration

**The cost of misalignment:**
- 60-70% of marketing leads never followed up by sales (wasted marketing spend)
- Sales spends time on unqualified leads (low productivity)
- Marketing doesn't get feedback on lead quality (can't optimize)
- Competing priorities create organizational friction
- Prospects get confused or ignored (poor customer experience)
- Revenue targets missed due to preventable inefficiencies

## The Sales-Marketing Alignment Framework

### 1. Shared Definitions and Terminology

**Lead Stage Definitions**

The foundation of alignment is agreeing on what each stage means:

```
RAW LEAD / CONTACT:
Definition: Any person whose information entered your database
Source: Website form, list import, trade show scan, manual entry
Qualification: None yet (may or may not fit ICP)
Owner: Marketing
Next Step: Enrichment and initial qualification

MARKETING QUALIFIED LEAD (MQL):
Definition: Lead that meets basic qualification criteria and shows intent
Qualification Criteria (example):
  - Company size: 50-500 employees ✓
  - Industry: B2B SaaS, Tech, Professional Services ✓
  - Job title: Manager, Director, VP, C-Suite ✓
  - Behavioral signal: Downloaded content, attended webinar, visited pricing page ✓
Owner: Marketing
Next Step: Route to Sales for follow-up

SALES ACCEPTED LEAD (SAL):
Definition: MQL that sales agrees to work (not rejected)
Qualification: Sales reviewed and confirmed fit
Owner: Sales (SDR/BDR)
Next Step: Outreach and discovery
Timing: Accepted within 24 hours of MQL handoff

SALES QUALIFIED LEAD (SQL):
Definition: Lead that has been contacted, responds, and confirms need/interest
Qualification: BANT or similar framework
  - Budget: Has budget or can get budget
  - Authority: Connected to decision-maker
  - Need: Confirmed pain point or need
  - Timeline: Active buying process (within 3-6 months)
Owner: Sales (SDR passes to AE)
Next Step: Discovery call or demo

OPPORTUNITY:
Definition: SQL with defined deal parameters
Qualification:
  - Decision-maker identified and engaged
  - Budget confirmed
  - Timeline defined
  - Solution aligned to need
  - Proposal or demo in progress
Owner: Sales (AE)
Next Step: Progress through sales stages to close

CLOSED-WON:
Definition: Contract signed, payment collected
Owner: Sales (AE) → Customer Success
Next Step: Onboarding

CLOSED-LOST:
Definition: Opportunity that didn't close
Reason: Captured (competitor, no budget, timing, no decision, etc.)
Owner: Sales (AE)
Next Step: Feedback to marketing, nurture for future
```

**ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Agreement**

Marketing and sales must agree on who to target:

```
FIRMOGRAPHIC (COMPANY) CRITERIA:
- Industry: B2B SaaS, Professional Services, Tech
- Company size: 50-500 employees (sweet spot: 100-200)
- Revenue: $10M-$100M annually
- Location: North America, UK, Australia
- Technology stack: Uses Salesforce, HubSpot, or similar CRM
- Funding stage: Series A+ or profitable (not pre-seed)

DEMOGRAPHIC (CONTACT) CRITERIA:
- Job titles: VP Sales, CRO, Director of Sales Ops, RevOps Manager
- Seniority: Director+ (decision-maker or strong influencer)
- Department: Sales, Revenue Operations, Marketing Ops

BEHAVIORAL (INTENT) SIGNALS:
- High intent: Demo request, pricing page view, contact sales
- Medium intent: Case study download, webinar attendance, product page visit
- Low intent: Blog read, newsletter signup, whitepaper download

NEGATIVE CRITERIA (DISQUALIFIERS):
- Company size < 10 employees (too small)
- Industry: Non-profit, government, education (out of scope)
- Geography: Countries we don't support
- Job title: Student, intern, agency (not buyer)
- Email domain: gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com (not business email)

DOCUMENT AND SHARE:
Create one-page ICP doc, review quarterly
Both teams must follow (no exceptions without reason)
Update based on win/loss analysis
```

**Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**

Commit to specific response times and actions:

```
MARKETING → SALES SLA:

1. LEAD VOLUME COMMITMENT:
   "Marketing will deliver [X] MQLs per month"
   Example: 100 MQLs/month (based on sales capacity and win rates)

2. LEAD QUALITY COMMITMENT:
   "At least [Y]% of MQLs will convert to SQL"
   Example: 25% MQL-to-SQL conversion rate
   If below 20% for 2 consecutive months → review qualification criteria

3. LEAD ROUTING TIMING:
   "MQLs will be routed to sales within [Z] hours"
   Example: Within 4 hours during business hours (faster = better)

4. LEAD INFORMATION COMPLETENESS:
   "All MQLs will have: Name, Email, Company, Job Title, Lead Source, Intent Signal"
   Example: 90%+ of MQLs will have completeness score of 80+

SALES → MARKETING SLA:

1. LEAD FOLLOW-UP COMMITMENT:
   "Sales will contact all MQLs within [X] hours"
   Example: Within 24 hours (first call attempt)
   Within 72 hours (minimum 3 contact attempts)

2. LEAD ACCEPTANCE/REJECTION TIMING:
   "Sales will accept or reject MQL (with reason) within [Y] hours"
   Example: Within 24 hours of receipt
   Rejection reason required (Not ICP, Bad Data, Already in Pipeline, etc.)

3. CONVERSION RATE TARGET:
   "Sales will convert at least [Z]% of MQLs to SQL"
   Example: 25% MQL → SQL conversion
   If below 20% → Sales coaching or skills gap identified

4. FEEDBACK LOOP COMMITMENT:
   "Sales will provide feedback on lead quality weekly"
   Example: Weekly meeting to discuss lead quality issues
   Monthly report on rejection reasons

5. CLOSED-LOOP REPORTING:
   "Sales will update lead status in CRM within 24 hours of status change"
   Example: Mark as SQL, Opportunity, Closed-Won, Closed-Lost (with reason)
   Required for marketing attribution and optimization

ENFORCEMENT:
- Track SLA compliance in dashboard (visible to both teams)
- Monthly SLA review meeting
- Escalation process if SLA consistently missed
```

### 2. Lead Scoring and Routing

**Lead Scoring Model**

Assign points based on fit and behavior:

```
FIT SCORE (0-100 points) - Who they are:

Company Size:
- 1-10 employees: -10 points (too small)
- 11-50 employees: +10 points (small but viable)
- 51-200 employees: +25 points (sweet spot)
- 201-500 employees: +20 points (good fit)
- 501+ employees: +10 points (large, longer sales cycle)

Industry:
- Target industries (B2B SaaS, Tech, Professional Services): +20 points
- Secondary industries (Manufacturing, Healthcare): +10 points
- Non-target industries: 0 points
- Excluded industries (Nonprofit, Gov): -50 points

Job Title/Seniority:
- C-Suite (CEO, CRO, CMO): +30 points (decision-maker)
- VP level: +25 points (decision-maker)
- Director level: +20 points (influencer/decision-maker)
- Manager level: +10 points (user/influencer)
- IC/Coordinator: +5 points (user only)
- Student/Intern: -20 points (not buyer)

Geography:
- North America: +10 points
- UK/Western Europe: +10 points
- Australia/NZ: +5 points
- Other (if we don't support): -20 points

ENGAGEMENT SCORE (0-100 points) - What they did:

High-Intent Actions:
- Demo request: +50 points (ready to talk)
- Pricing page view: +30 points (evaluating)
- Contact sales form: +40 points
- Free trial signup: +40 points

Medium-Intent Actions:
- Webinar attendance: +20 points
- Case study download: +15 points
- Product page visit: +10 points
- Multiple return visits (5+): +15 points

Low-Intent Actions:
- Blog post read: +5 points
- Newsletter signup: +5 points
- Whitepaper download: +5 points
- Single website visit: +2 points

Email Engagement:
- Email open: +2 points (per open, max 10)
- Email click: +5 points (per click, max 20)
- Reply to email: +25 points (direct engagement)

Decay:
- No engagement in 60 days: -50% of engagement score
- No engagement in 90 days: -100% of engagement score

TOTAL LEAD SCORE = Fit Score + Engagement Score

THRESHOLDS:
- 80-100: Hot Lead (immediate outreach, high priority)
- 60-79: Warm Lead (MQL, outreach within 24 hours)
- 40-59: Cool Lead (nurture, not ready for sales)
- <40: Cold Lead (long-term nurture or disqualify)

MQL THRESHOLD = 60 points minimum
```

**Lead Routing Logic**

Automate assignment to the right sales rep:

```
ROUTING RULES:

IF Lead Score ≥ 80 AND Company Size ≥ 200 employees:
  → Assign to Enterprise AE (round-robin among Enterprise team)
  → Flag as "Hot Lead"
  → Send Slack notification to AE
  → Target response: <4 hours

ELSE IF Lead Score ≥ 60 AND Company Size 50-200 employees:
  → Assign to Mid-Market AE (round-robin)
  → Flag as "Warm Lead"
  → Target response: <24 hours

ELSE IF Lead Score ≥ 60 AND Company Size < 50 employees:
  → Assign to SMB SDR (round-robin)
  → Add to outbound sequence (email + LinkedIn)
  → Target response: <24 hours

ELSE IF Lead Source = "Referral":
  → Assign to referral partner owner (regardless of score)
  → Flag as "Referral"
  → Target response: <4 hours (high-priority)

ELSE IF Lead Score 40-59:
  → Assign to Marketing Nurture Sequence
  → No sales assignment yet
  → Re-score after engagement

ELSE IF Lead Score < 40:
  → Mark as "Unqualified"
  → Add to long-term newsletter
  → Notify marketing of rejection reason

GEOGRAPHY ROUTING:
- North America: US/Canada team
- EMEA: UK/Europe team
- APAC: Australia/Asia team (if coverage exists)

NAMED ACCOUNTS:
- If company is on Target Account List (ABM)
  → Override round-robin, assign to dedicated account owner
  → Flag as "Target Account"

EXISTING CONTACTS:
- If contact already exists in CRM with open opportunity
  → Don't create duplicate, add activity to existing record
  → Notify existing owner of new engagement
```

### 3. Handoff Process and Communication

**Lead Handoff Workflow**

Structured process from marketing to sales:

```
STEP 1: MARKETING QUALIFICATION (MQL Creation)
- Lead reaches 60+ lead score
- Automated: CRM creates MQL record
- Automated: Enrichment runs (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.)
- Automated: Routing logic assigns to sales rep
- Automated: Email + Slack notification to assigned rep

STEP 2: SALES NOTIFICATION (0-4 hours)
Sales rep receives:
- Email: "New MQL assigned: [Name] from [Company]"
- Slack: "@John: Hot lead assigned - [Name], [Company], [Score]"
- CRM: Lead appears in "My MQLs" view

Notification includes:
- Lead score breakdown (Fit: 65, Engagement: 25, Total: 90)
- Intent signals (Visited pricing page 3x, downloaded case study)
- Company info (employees, revenue, industry, tech stack)
- Recent activity (timeline of interactions)
- Suggested talking points (based on content consumed)

STEP 3: SALES REVIEW (Within 24 hours)
Rep reviews lead and makes decision:

Option A: ACCEPT
- Rep accepts lead ("This looks good, I'll work it")
- Lead status → "Sales Accepted Lead (SAL)"
- Rep begins outreach within 24 hours

Option B: REJECT (with reason)
- Rep rejects lead: "Not a fit because..."
- Rejection reasons (dropdown):
  • Already in pipeline (duplicate)
  • Doesn't meet ICP (too small, wrong industry)
  • Bad data (fake email, incomplete info)
  • Competitor or agency
  • Out of territory
  • Other (specify)
- Lead returns to marketing for nurture or re-assignment
- Marketing reviews rejection patterns monthly

STEP 4: SALES OUTREACH (Within 24-48 hours)
First contact attempt:
- Personalized email (reference their activity: "Saw you downloaded our case study...")
- LinkedIn connection request + message
- Phone call (if number available)

Sequence: 3 touches in first 72 hours
- Day 1: Email + LinkedIn
- Day 2: Phone call + voicemail
- Day 3: Follow-up email

STEP 5: LEAD PROGRESSION
Possible outcomes:

A. CONNECTED → SQL:
- Rep connects with lead
- Confirms fit (BANT qualification)
- Lead status → "Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)"
- Books discovery call or demo
- Marketing notified (SQL conversion tracked)

B. NO RESPONSE → NURTURE:
- 3+ attempts, no response
- Lead status → "Attempting Contact"
- After 10 days, move to "Unresponsive"
- Return to marketing nurture (automated email sequence)
- Re-engage if new activity (scored trigger)

C. DISQUALIFIED → CLOSED-LOST:
- Connected, but not a fit (no budget, wrong timing, not interested)
- Lead status → "Disqualified"
- Capture reason (for marketing feedback)
- Add to long-term nurture or remove

STEP 6: CLOSED-LOOP REPORTING
Sales updates CRM, marketing sees results:
- MQL → SQL conversion rate (target: 25%)
- SQL → Opportunity conversion rate (target: 40%)
- Opportunity → Closed-Won rate (target: 30%)
- Time in each stage
- Win/loss reasons

Marketing uses data to optimize:
- Which campaigns drive best MQL → SQL rates?
- Which content correlates with closed-won deals?
- Which lead sources have highest LTV?
```

**Weekly Sync Meeting**

Regular meeting to maintain alignment:

```
ATTENDEES:
- VP Sales or Sales Leader
- VP Marketing or Demand Gen Leader
- SDR Manager (if applicable)
- RevOps (optional, but recommended)

FREQUENCY: Weekly, 30 minutes

   - MQL → SQL conversion: [Y%] (vs target 25%)
   - SQL → Opp conversion: [Z%]
   - New pipeline created: [$]
   - Closed-won deals: [$]

   This Week Forecast:
   - MQLs expected: [X]
   - Pipeline coverage: [X]x (goal: 3-4x)

2. LEAD QUALITY DISCUSSION (10 minutes):
   - Sales feedback on lead quality
   - Rejection rate and reasons

   - Adjustments needed? (scoring, ICP, messaging)

3. CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE (5 minutes):
   - What's working? (campaigns driving SQLs/pipeline)
   - What's not? (high volume, low conversion)
   - Upcoming campaigns (heads up to sales)

4. FEEDBACK LOOP (5 minutes):
   - Recent wins: What worked? (marketing can do more)
   - Recent losses: Why lost? (competitor, price, timing)
   - Customer stories (for case studies, testimonials)

5. ACTION ITEMS (5 minutes):
   - Follow-ups from last meeting
   - New action items (owner + due date)

OUTPUT:
- Shared notes doc (visible to both teams)
- Action items tracked (CRM or project management tool)
```

### 4. Revenue Goals and Shared Metrics

**Shared Revenue Target**

Both teams accountable for same goal:

```
COMPANY REVENUE TARGET: $5M ARR (end of year)

REVERSE ENGINEERING:

New ARR Needed:
- Current ARR: $3M
- Target ARR: $5M
- Growth needed: $2M new ARR

Monthly New ARR: $2M / 12 months = $167K/month

Deals Needed:
- Average ACV: $25,000
- Deals per month: $167K / $25K = 6.7 → 7 deals/month

Pipeline Needed:
- Win rate: 30%
- Pipeline needed: 7 deals / 30% = 23 opportunities/month
- At $25K ACV = $575K pipeline/month

SQLs Needed:
- SQL → Opp rate: 40%
- SQLs needed: 23 opps / 40% = 58 SQLs/month

MQLs Needed:
- MQL → SQL rate: 25%
- MQLs needed: 58 SQLs / 25% = 232 MQLs/month

TEAM GOALS:

MARKETING:
- Generate 232 MQLs/month (55 per week)
- Achieve 25% MQL → SQL conversion (pipeline contribution)
- Generate $575K pipeline/month (marketing-sourced)

SALES:
- Follow up on all MQLs within 24 hours (SLA)
- Convert 25% of MQLs to SQL (58 SQLs/month)
- Convert 40% of SQLs to Opportunities (23 opps/month)
- Win 30% of opportunities (7 closed-won/month)
- Close $167K new ARR/month

SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY:
Both teams miss target if either fails
Celebrate wins together, solve problems together
```

**Dashboard: Shared Metrics**

- Top Competitors (in lost deals)
- Sales Feedback Score (on lead quality, 1-10)

UPDATE FREQUENCY:
- Real-time (or daily refresh)
- Reviewed in weekly sync meeting
- Tracked against monthly/quarterly targets
```

### 5. Lead Nurturing and Recycling

**Marketing Nurture Programs**

Not every lead is ready for sales immediately:

```
NURTURE SEGMENT 1: NOT YET QUALIFIED (Score 40-59)
- Not yet MQL (score too low)
- Needs education and engagement
- Nurture Goal: Increase score to 60+ (MQL threshold)

NURTURE TACTICS:
- Email: 2-3 emails/month (educational content, not salesy)
- Content: Blog posts, how-to guides, webinars
- Retargeting: Show ads for valuable content
- Social: LinkedIn engagement, thought leadership
- Duration: 3-6 months (or until they engage)

EXIT CRITERIA:
- Score reaches 60+ → Hand to sales as MQL
- No engagement for 90 days → Move to long-term nurture
- Unsubscribe → Remove from nurture

NURTURE SEGMENT 2: UNRESPONSIVE LEADS (Sales Attempted, No Response)
- Sales tried 3+ times, no reply
- May be timing issue, not interest
- Nurture Goal: Re-engage, hand back to sales when active

NURTURE TACTICS:
- Email: 1-2 emails/month (value-focused, not "checking in")
- Trigger-based: Alert sales if high-intent action (pricing page, case study)
- Case studies and social proof (build trust while nurturing)
- Event invites (webinar, conference)

EXIT CRITERIA:
- High-intent action (score +30) → Alert sales, re-engage
- Replies to email → Hand to sales immediately
- 6 months no engagement → Archive

NURTURE SEGMENT 3: DISQUALIFIED (Not Ready, Wrong Timing)
- Sales qualified, but "call us in 6 months" or "budget next year"
- Nurture Goal: Stay top-of-mind until timing is right

NURTURE TACTICS:
- Email: 1 email/month (relevant updates, case studies)
- Personalized: Reference their specific situation ("You mentioned evaluating in Q3...")
- Calendar reminder for sales rep (follow up when timing arrives)

EXIT CRITERIA:
- Timing arrives (Q3, next year, etc.) → Sales re-engages
- Lead reaches out proactively → Priority handoff
- Company situation changes (funding, headcount growth) → Re-engage

NURTURE BEST PRACTICES:
✓ Segment nurture (don't blast same email to all)
✓ Personalize (reference their role, industry, pain point)
✓ Provide value (not "just checking in" emails)
✓ Use triggers (alert sales when behavior changes)
✗ Don't over-email (max 3-4/month)
✗ Don't ignore nurture leads (they're future pipeline)
```

**Lead Recycling Program**

Bring cold leads back to life:

```
RECYCLING TRIGGER 1: CLOSED-LOST DEALS (Lost to competitor, timing, budget)
- Re-engage after 6-12 months
- Assumption: Situation may have changed

APPROACH:
- "Hi [Name], we spoke last year about [solution]. I know timing wasn't right then..."
- Share new features, case studies, or wins since last conversation
- "Would it make sense to reconnect for 15 minutes?"

SUCCESS RATE: 10-15% of closed-lost deals re-open within 12 months

RECYCLING TRIGGER 2: JOB CHANGE (Contact moved to new company)
- Monitor LinkedIn for job changes (LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
- Former contact may have new need at new company

APPROACH:
- "Congrats on the new role at [New Company]! How's it going?"
- "Are you facing similar challenges at [New Company]?"
- Warm intro (not cold outreach)

SUCCESS RATE: 20-30% conversion (warm relationship, familiar with solution)

RECYCLING TRIGGER 3: COMPANY CHANGE (Funding, acquisition, growth signal)
- Monitor for trigger events:
  • Announced funding round (Crunchbase, LinkedIn)
  • Rapid hiring (LinkedIn, job boards)
  • New leadership (CRO, CMO hired)
  • Product launch or expansion

APPROACH:
- "Saw [Company] raised Series B - congrats! As you scale, [our solution] could help with [pain point]..."
- Timely, relevant outreach (not random)

SUCCESS RATE: 15-20% conversion (triggered by real need)
```

### 6. Attribution and Reporting

**Multi-Touch Attribution**

Give credit to both marketing and sales:

```
ATTRIBUTION MODEL: W-Shaped (30/30/30/10)

30% Credit: First Touch (Awareness)
- Marketing campaign that generated initial contact
- Example: Blog post, LinkedIn ad, webinar registration

30% Credit: MQL Conversion (Qualification)
- Marketing campaign that converted lead to MQL
- Example: Case study download, pricing page visit, webinar attendance

30% Credit: Opportunity Creation (Sales Engagement)
- Sales activity that converted SQL to Opportunity
- Example: Discovery call, demo, proposal sent

10% Credit: Closed-Won (Closing)
- Final sales activities
- Example: Negotiation, contract, executive engagement

EXAMPLE DEAL:
Customer: Acme Corp, $50K ACV

Journey:
1. Downloaded ebook via LinkedIn ad (First Touch - Marketing)
2. Attended webinar (MQL Conversion - Marketing)
3. Discovery call with AE (Opportunity Creation - Sales)
4. Demo and proposal (Sales)
5. Negotiation and close (Sales)

ATTRIBUTION:
- LinkedIn ad: 30% ($15K)
- Webinar: 30% ($15K)
- Discovery call (Sales): 30% ($15K)
- Closing activities (Sales): 10% ($5K)

ROLL-UP:
- Marketing-attributed: $30K (60%)
- Sales-attributed: $20K (40%)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Gives marketing credit for pipeline contribution
- Acknowledges sales' role in conversion
- Prevents "Marketing generated nothing" or "Sales got credit for marketing work" arguments
- Enables data-driven budget allocation
```

**Win/Loss Analysis**

Learn from every deal:

```
WIN ANALYSIS (After every Closed-Won):

QUESTIONS FOR SALES REP:
1. What marketing content did they mention? (case study, webinar, etc.)
2. What was the primary reason they chose us? (product, price, service, trust)
3. Who was our main competitor? (if any)
4. What objections did we overcome? (price, features, implementation)
5. Was there a champion? How did we find them?

SHARE WITH MARKETING:
- Top-performing content (do more of this)
- Winning messages (use in campaigns)
- Competitor positioning (refine messaging)
- Champion profile (target similar personas)

LOSS ANALYSIS (After every Closed-Lost):

QUESTIONS FOR SALES REP:
1. Why did we lose? (competitor, price, no decision, timing, product gaps)
2. Who did they choose instead? (competitor intel)
3. What could we have done differently? (learning opportunity)
4. Was lead quality an issue? (marketing feedback)
5. Was there a deal-breaker feature? (product feedback)

SHARE WITH MARKETING:
- Lead quality issues (adjust scoring, ICP)
- Competitor intel (adjust positioning)
- Price objections (consider packaging changes)
- Messaging gaps (refine value prop)

PROCESS:
- Sales completes brief survey in CRM (2 minutes)
- Marketing reviews monthly report
- Quarterly deep-dive with top losses (interview customer if willing)
- Adjust campaigns, messaging, scoring based on insights
```

**Value:**
```
SCENARIO: $3M ARR company, misaligned sales & marketing

BEFORE ALIGNMENT:
- Marketing generates 200 MQLs/month
- 60% ignored by sales (no follow-up) = 120 wasted MQLs
- 40% worked = 80 MQLs
- 15% MQL → SQL (low quality + poor handoff) = 12 SQLs
- 25% SQL → Opp = 3 opps
- 30% Opp → Customer = 0.9 deals/month (11 deals/year)
- At $25K ACV = $275K new ARR/year

- Marketing-Sales friction (blame game)
- Long sales cycles (poor handoff)
- Low morale (both teams)

AFTER ALIGNMENT:
- Marketing generates 200 MQLs/month (same volume)
- 95% followed up by sales (SLA adherence) = 190 worked MQLs
- 30% MQL → SQL (better quality + better handoff) = 57 SQLs
- 40% SQL → Opp (sales more effective) = 23 opps
- 35% Opp → Customer (better lead quality) = 8 deals/month (96 deals/year)
- At $25K ACV = $2.4M new ARR/year

INCREMENTAL VALUE:
New ARR lift: $2.4M - $275K = $2.125M additional ARR/year
First-year revenue impact: $2.125M
Investment: $37,000

ROI: 5,643%
Payback: <2 weeks

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS:
- Reduced sales cycle (30 days shorter) = faster revenue
- Higher team morale (collaboration vs. finger-pointing)
- Better marketing spend efficiency (know what works)
- Predictable pipeline (accurate forecasting)

## Common Alignment Mistakes

**1. No Shared Definitions**
- **Mistake:** "MQL" means different things to sales and marketing
- **Impact:** Confusion, blame game, poor handoffs
- **Solution:** Document clear definitions, get sign-off from both teams

**2. Volume Over Quality**
- **Mistake:** Marketing judged on lead quantity, not quality
- **Impact:** Sales overwhelmed with junk leads, ignores all leads
- **Solution:** Track MQL → SQL conversion rate (quality metric)

**3. No SLAs**
- **Mistake:** No agreement on response times or actions
- **Impact:** Leads ignored, finger-pointing ("We sent them, you didn't follow up")
- **Solution:** Define SLAs, track compliance in dashboard

**4. One-Way Handoff**
- **Mistake:** Marketing throws leads over wall, never hears back
- **Impact:** Marketing can't optimize, keeps generating bad leads
- **Solution:** Closed-loop reporting, weekly feedback meetings

**5. Separate Goals**
- **Mistake:** Marketing measured on leads, sales measured on revenue
- **Impact:** Misaligned incentives, optimize for different things
- **Solution:** Shared revenue goal, shared pipeline target

**6. No Lead Recycling**
- **Mistake:** "Not ready now" leads discarded forever
- **Impact:** Wasted marketing spend, missed future opportunities
- **Solution:** Nurture programs, recycling based on triggers

**7. Blaming, Not Problem-Solving**
- **Mistake:** "Marketing leads suck" vs "Sales doesn't follow up"
- **Impact:** Organizational dysfunction, low morale
- **Solution:** Weekly syncs focused on problem-solving, not blame

**8. No Tools/Automation**
- **Mistake:** Manual lead handoff (email, spreadsheet)
- **Impact:** Leads fall through cracks, slow response times
- **Solution:** CRM automation, lead routing, SLA alerts

**Next Steps:**
1. Document shared definitions (ICP, MQL, SQL, Opportunity) - this week
2. Define SLAs (lead volume, response time, conversion rates) - this week
3. Build shared dashboard (track MQL → SQL → Opp → Customer) - next week
4. Set up weekly sync meeting (30 min, consistent time) - this week
5. Implement lead routing automation (CRM workflows) - next 2 weeks
6. Create closed-loop reporting (win/loss feedback to marketing) - ongoing

**Remember:** Alignment is not a one-time project. It requires ongoing communication, shared goals, and mutual accountability. Start with shared definitions and SLAs, then iterate based on what you learn. When sales and marketing row in the same direction, revenue growth accelerates dramatically.
