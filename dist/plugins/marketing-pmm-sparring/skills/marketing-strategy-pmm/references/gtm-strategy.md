# Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy
### 4.1 GTM Motion Types

**PLG (Product-Led Growth)**:

- Entry: Free trial or freemium
- Buyer: End user → Manager → VP
- Sales: Low touch or self-serve
- ACV: <$10k
- Example: Slack, Notion, Figma

**Sales-Led Growth**:

- Entry: Demo request → Sales qualification
- Buyer: VP → C-level
- Sales: High touch, consultative
- ACV: $25k+
- Example: Salesforce, Workday, SAP

**Hybrid (PLG + Sales)**:

- Entry: Free trial for SMB, demo for Enterprise
- Buyer: End user (PLG) or Executive (Sales-Led)
- Sales: Self-serve → Assisted → Enterprise
- ACV: $5k-$100k
- Example: HubSpot, Atlassian, Zoom

**Series A Recommendation**: Start with **Hybrid**

- Reason: Faster learning, broader TAM, efficient scaling
- Approach:
