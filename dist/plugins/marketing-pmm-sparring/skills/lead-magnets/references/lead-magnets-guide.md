## Measuring Success

- **Target:**
  - Blog post content upgrade: 20-40%
  - Dedicated landing page: 10-30%
  - Popup: 2-10%
  - Social media post: 1-5%

**Email opens (delivery email):**
- **Target:** 40-60%

- **Target:** 5-10% per month

---

### Optimization

**If low conversion rate:**
- Test headline (more specific benefit)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too broad
**Problem:** "Marketing Tips" isn't specific
**Fix:** "10 LinkedIn Posts That Generated 500 Leads"

### ❌ Too long
**Problem:** 50-page ebook no one finishes
**Fix:** 5-10 page quick win guide

### ❌ No CTA
**Problem:** They download but don't know what's next
**Fix:** Clear CTA in lead magnet (book call, buy product, join community)

### ❌ Poor design
**Problem:** Looks unprofessional, hard to read
**Fix:** Use Canva templates, proper formatting

### ❌ Not delivering
**Problem:** Download link broken, email not sent
**Fix:** Test the full funnel before promoting

### ❌ No follow-up
**Problem:** They download, then crickets
**Fix:** Welcome sequence (5-7 emails)

---

## Pro Tips

### Repurpose Existing Content
- Blog post → Checklist
- Video → Transcript guide
- Webinar → Slides + workbook
- Email series → Ebook

**1 hour to repurpose vs. 10 hours to create new**

---

### Create Bundles
Package multiple lead magnets:
```

→ Checklist (new)
→ Case studies (from emails)

High perceived value, minimal extra work.
```

---

### Gate Your Best Content
```
Blog post: Share 70% of framework
Lead magnet: Full framework + templates

Social post: Tease 3 of 10 tips
Lead magnet: All 10 with examples
```

---

### Use "Cheat Code" Language
```

✅ "Ultimate guide"

People love shortcuts.
```
