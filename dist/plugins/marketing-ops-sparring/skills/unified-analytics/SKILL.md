# Unified Analytics

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build unified content analytics dashboards. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building Analytics Dashboard

- [ ] Define key metrics (traffic, engagement, conversions, ROI)
- [ ] Connect data sources (GA, social, CRM, email)
- [ ] Build dashboard (Google Data Studio, Tableau, or custom)
- [ ] Set up UTM tracking for all content
- [ ] Track by content type, channel, topic
- [ ] Calculate content ROI (revenue / cost)
- [ ] Identify top performers
- [ ] Review weekly, optimize monthly

## Key Frameworks

- **AAARRR Metrics**: Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, Referral
- **Content Attribution Models**: First-touch, last-touch, multi-touch
- **Vanity vs. Actionable Metrics**: Focus on metrics that drive decisions
- **North Star Metric**: One metric that best predicts long-term success

## Key Metrics

- **Traffic**: Pageviews, unique visitors, time on page
- **Engagement**: Scroll depth, video watch time, social shares
- **Conversion**: Leads, MQLs, customers from content
- **ROI**: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost × 100

## Quick Wins

- Use UTM parameters consistently
- Track "Assisted Conversions" (content touchpoints)
- Focus on revenue metrics, not just traffic
