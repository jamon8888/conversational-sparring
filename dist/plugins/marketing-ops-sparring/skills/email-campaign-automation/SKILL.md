# Email Campaign Automation

## Quick Start

This skill helps you build automated email sequences. For complete frameworks, see the [Complete Guide](references/guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Building Email Automation

- [ ] Define trigger (signup, download, behavior)
- [ ] Plan sequence (5-7 emails over 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Write emails with clear goal per email
- [ ] Set up automation in ESP
- [ ] Define exit conditions (purchased, unsubscribed)
- [ ] Test sequence with sample data
- [ ] Launch to segment
- [ ] Monitor open/click rates
- [ ] Optimize based on data

## Key Frameworks

- **Trigger-Based Marketing**: Automate based on behavior (opened, clicked, purchased)
- **Drip Campaign Strategy**: Time-based sequences with increasing value/urgency
- **Lead Scoring Integration**: Adjust sequence based on engagement level

## Common Sequences

- **Welcome**: 5 emails over 10 days
- **Nurture**: 7 emails over 21 days
- **Abandoned Cart**: 3 emails over 5 days
- **Onboarding**: 10 emails over 30 days
- **Re-engagement**: 3 emails over 7 days

## Quick Wins

- Start with welcome sequence (highest engagement)
- Use behavior triggers (clicked, didn't open)
- Test send times (2pm-4pm local time)
- A/B test subject lines
