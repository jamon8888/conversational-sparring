# Content Governance

## Quick Start

Implement approval workflows, compliance checking, and brand validation for enterprise content operations. Supports standard, expedited, and legal review workflows with complete audit trails.

For complete workflow templates and compliance checklists, see the [Complete Guide](references/governance-guide.md).

## Execution Checklist

### Set Up Governance Workflow

- [ ] Choose workflow type (standard, expedited, legal review)
- [ ] Define approval stages and approvers
- [ ] Set up compliance checklists (GDPR, CCPA, brand)
- [ ] Create audit trail template
- [ ] Test workflow with sample content
- [ ] Train team on approval process
- [ ] Monitor and optimize workflow

## Key Frameworks

- **Approval Workflow Stages**: Draft → Review → Legal (if needed) → Approve → Publish
- **Compliance First**: Check GDPR, CCPA, industry regulations before publication
- **Brand Validation**: Automated checks for voice, tone, terminology consistency
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all decisions, actors, timestamps for compliance

## Workflow Types

### Standard Workflow (Most content)

1. **Draft** (Creator)
2. **Review** (Content Manager)
3. **Approve** (Team Lead)
4. **Publish** (Publisher)

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Use for**: Blog posts, social content, newsletters

### Expedited Workflow (Time-sensitive)

1. **Draft** (Creator)
2. **Fast Review** (Manager) - same day
3. **Publish** (Creator)

**Duration**: Same day  
**Use for**: News responses, timely social posts, urgent announcements

### Legal Review Workflow (High-risk)

1. **Draft** (Creator)
2. **Review** (Content Manager)
3. **Legal Review** (Legal Team)
4. **Executive Approval** (CMO/VP)
5. **Publish** (Publisher)

**Duration**: 5-7 days  
**Use for**: Public statements, financial content, regulatory content, contracts

## Quick Wins

- **Start with standard workflow** - Don't overcomplicate initially
- **Automate compliance checks** - Use scripts to validate before human review
- **Clear SLAs** - Each stage has maximum time (24h review, 48h legal)
- **Escalation path** - Define what happens when deadlines are missed
- **Regular audits** - Monthly review of audit trail for process improvement
