# Revenue Waterfall Framework

## Overview
The complete journey from marketing lead to closed customer, with conversion benchmarks at each stage.

## The Revenue Waterfall Stages

```
Inquiries/Raw Leads
        ↓ (20-30% conversion)
Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL)
        ↓ (30-40% conversion)
Sales Accepted Leads (SAL)
        ↓ (50-60% conversion)
Sales Qualified Leads (SQL)
        ↓ (20-30% conversion)
Opportunities
        ↓ (25-35% conversion)
Closed Won
```

## Stage Definitions

### 1. Inquiry/Raw Lead
**Definition**: Anyone who shows interest

**Sources**:
- Website form fills
- Content downloads
- Event registrations
- Inbound calls
- Chat conversations

**Criteria**: Minimal (email address)

### 2. Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
**Definition**: Lead that meets minimum qualification criteria

**Criteria** (score-based):
- Demographic fit (title, company size, industry)
- Behavioral engagement (page views, downloads, email opens)
- BANT indicators (budget, authority, need, timing)

**Scoring Example**:
```
Demographics (max 50 points):
- VP+ title: 25 points
- Target industry: 15 points
- Company size 100+: 10 points

Behavior (max 50 points):
- Pricing page view: 20 points
- Demo request: 30 points
- Email engagement: 10 points

MQL Threshold: 60+ points
```

**Conversion Rate**: 20-30% of inquiries become MQLs

### 3. Sales Accepted Lead (SAL)
**Definition**: MQL reviewed and accepted by sales

**Criteria**:
- Sales confirms fit
- Contact info verified
- No immediate disqualifiers
- Assigned to rep

**SLA**: Sales reviews within 24 hours

**Conversion Rate**: 30-40% of MQLs become SALs

### 4. Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)
**Definition**: Lead actively engaged and qualified by sales

**Qualification** (BANT):
- **Budget**: Has or can get budget
- **Authority**: Decision maker or influencer
- **Need**: Clear pain point
- **Timing**: Buying within 90 days

**Activities**:
- Discovery call completed
- MEDDICC/BANT scorecard filled
- Next steps agreed

**Conversion Rate**: 50-60% of SALs become SQLs

### 5. Opportunity
**Definition**: Qualified deal in active sales process

**Criteria**:
- Formal evaluation started
- Budget confirmed
- Timeline established
- Deal amount estimated
- Competition identified

**Stages**:
- Needs Analysis
- Proposal
- Negotiation

**Conversion Rate**: 20-30% of SQLs become Opportunities

### 6. Closed Won
**Definition**: Contract signed, customer onboarded

**Criteria**:
- Contract executed
- Payment received (or scheduled)
- Implementation started

**Conversion Rate**: 25-35% of Opportunities close won

## Conversion Benchmarks

### Overall Funnel
```
1,000 Inquiries
  ↓ 25%
250 MQLs
  ↓ 35%
88 SALs
  ↓ 55%
48 SQLs
  ↓ 25%
12 Opportunities
  ↓ 30%
4 Closed Won

Overall Conversion: 0.4% (Inquiry to Customer)
```

### By Industry

**B2B SaaS**:
- Inquiry → MQL: 20-25%
- MQL → SQL: 15-20%
- SQL → Opportunity: 25-30%
- Opportunity → Won: 25-30%

**Enterprise Software**:
- Inquiry → MQL: 15-20%
- MQL → SQL: 10-15%
- SQL → Opportunity: 30-40%
- Opportunity → Won: 20-25%

**SMB Services**:
- Inquiry → MQL: 30-40%
- MQL → SQL: 20-25%
- SQL → Opportunity: 40-50%
- Opportunity → Won: 30-40%

## Velocity Metrics

### Time in Stage

**MQL → SAL**: <24 hours
**SAL → SQL**: 3-7 days
**SQL → Opportunity**: 7-14 days
**Opportunity → Closed**: 30-90 days

**Total Sales Cycle**:
- SMB: 30-60 days
- Mid-Market: 60-120 days
- Enterprise: 120-270 days

### Sales Velocity Formula
```
Sales Velocity = (# Opportunities × Avg Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length

Example:
- 50 opportunities
- $10K avg deal
- 30% win rate
- 60 day cycle

Velocity = (50 × $10,000 × 0.30) / 60 = $2,500/day
Monthly Revenue = $2,500 × 30 = $75,000
```

## Waterfall Optimization

### Improve MQL Quality
- Tighten scoring criteria
- Better lead sources
- Content targeting
- Negative scoring (unsubscribes, bounces)

### Improve MQL → SQL Conversion
- Faster follow-up (<5 min)
- Better qualification questions
- Sales enablement
- Lead routing optimization

### Improve SQL → Opportunity
- Better discovery process
- Value proposition clarity
- Competitive differentiation
- Executive engagement

### Improve Win Rate
- Better qualification (MEDDICC)
- Proof of value (POC, trial)
- Negotiation skills
- Pricing optimization

## Reporting and Analytics

### Weekly Metrics
```
Stage Snapshot:
- Inquiries: 200 (↑15% WoW)
- MQLs: 50 (↑10% WoW)
- SALs: 18 (↑5% WoW)
- SQLs: 10 (↓5% WoW)
- Opportunities: 3 (→ flat)
- Closed Won: 1 (↑100% WoW)

Conversion Rates:
- Inquiry → MQL: 25% (target: 25%) ✓
- MQL → SAL: 36% (target: 35%) ✓
- SAL → SQL: 56% (target: 55%) ✓
- SQL → Opp: 30% (target: 25%) ✓
- Opp → Won: 33% (target: 30%) ✓
```

### Monthly Trends
- Waterfall volume by stage
- Conversion rates over time
- Velocity trends
- Win rate by source/segment

### Cohort Analysis
```
January 2024 MQL Cohort (100 MQLs):
- Month 1: 35 → SQL (35%)
- Month 2: 10 → Opportunity (10%)
- Month 3: 3 → Closed Won (3%)
- Final Conversion: 3%
```

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)

### Marketing to Sales
- MQL → SAL review: <24 hours
- MQL quality: >30% SAL acceptance
- Lead routing: <5 minutes

### Sales to Marketing
- SAL feedback: Within 48 hours
- Disqualification reason: Required
- Closed-loop reporting: Weekly

## Common Issues

### Leaky Funnel
**Symptom**: High drop-off at one stage
**Diagnosis**: Conversion rate <benchmark
**Fix**: Process improvement, training, tooling

### Slow Velocity
**Symptom**: Deals stuck in stages
**Diagnosis**: Long time-in-stage
**Fix**: Automation, follow-up cadences, management oversight

### Low Win Rate
**Symptom**: Opportunities not closing
**Diagnosis**: Win rate <25%
**Fix**: Better qualification, competitive positioning, pricing

### MQL/SQL Misalignment
**Symptom**: Sales rejects most MQLs
**Diagnosis**: SAL acceptance <30%
**Fix**: Scoring recalibration, definition alignment, feedback loop
